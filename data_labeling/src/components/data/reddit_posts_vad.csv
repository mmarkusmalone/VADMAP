Nothing I could ever do was right with her: I was too mean, or too sad, or I didn’t say the right thing, or I couldn’t fix a problem for her and it was my fault. I always knew why she was like that - she definitely wasn’t doing well herself - but it never occurred to me until recently that it had nothing to do with me. We were friends for 5 years, and the whole time I was absorbing what she said and taking it as the truth. When we were in middle school once, she put me in a group chat on kik (nothing good happened on kik) and sent a number of long paragraphs about how all of them hated me, and I was so mean and negative and not fun to be around. But despite everyone else telling me that they didn’t agree at all and she just did that herself, I believed HER. I, at 13, was the worst person ever, and would only continue to be until I cut her off at 18. The reason I cut her off, actually, is related to the bigger cause of this… blackout, I guess.","[-0.5318314116002383, 0.020070307531546983, -0.20518739537092556]",,,
"Cringe, I know, but I did theatre in high school. And college. And there’s a universe out there where I’m still doing it now. All my life, I wanted to do theatre. Growing up, I was always encouraged to perform. I’d tried dance classes and guitar lessons and cheer and voice lessons, and the one that really stuck was voice. At nine, I started attending voice lessons every Thursday. Every year after that until I was 15, I did summer music camps. I’d always wanted to be a performer - a singer and an actor. Then I met Ms. G. I wouldn’t know this until I was in too deep, but Ms. G had a reputation for not being nice to the girls. She had a… preference for the boys, you could say. She never did anything untoward, but she certainly liked the boys a lot better. But when I saw Seussical: The Musical, I knew I wanted to work with her. I wanted to do musical theatre. So I ask her what I should try to do in the next show, and she tells me Assistant Stage Manager. Cool! I just want to be involved! So I do it, and I like it okay. But I start dating one of the Theatre Boys. The musical comes and I chicken out of auditioning - everyone else seems so good. Plus, that friend from earlier was auditioning. I couldn’t take away her shot. I ASM again, it’s fine. She convinces me to partner up in leadership with my boyfriend at the time, and despite my hesitancy, I do it.","[0.5928370941338564, 0.16221089147123485, 0.3914544163337841]",,,

When I wanted to leave the position the following year, her and that friend seemed to come together to convince me not to. I would be betraying the team AND her if I did, and how could I do that? The following year, I audition for the musical. I receive a different crew role that I did not ask for. I’m not on the cast list, and it breaks my heart but I get it. Sobbing, I email her asking what I can do better next time. She replies, she left me off the cast list by mistake. Whatever. I was ensemble, which was fun. When she’s choosing our senior year musical, she tells me I HAVE to audition, there’s the perfect role for me. It’s a boy role, but for vocal reasons, casting a girl was better, as he’s very young. When the time comes around, i’m hesitant to audition again - I didn’t get chosen last time and I didn’t get chosen for competition, so I must not actually be good. I tell her I want to help her direct it. She tells me no, that if I apply for director and don’t audition, she will not include me at all. I audition, I fight for that role tooth and nail.

It derives from the Latin word for solitude.[3] It is often associated with a repressed understanding that one might never encounter the object of longing ever again. It is a recollection of feelings, experiences, places, or events, often elusive, that cause a sense of separation from the exciting, pleasant, or joyous sensations they once caused. 3.

When I was 5, I moved to a new city, and he was my first friend. He was my best friend for a long time; we'd spend afternoons playing, and he'd give me little gifts like rocks for my fish tank or treats for my cat. I especially remember one day when we went to his beach house; it was the first time I saw hail. We were around 8 years old, and we were in the pool when it started raining. Everyone else got out, but we hid under a bridge that went over one side of the pool. Maybe I had a crush on him, and I like thinking about that. Later that day, when we were playing with his siblings, he didn't want to heat up noodles to impress me. His brother teased him, saying something like, ""You're eating cold noodles to impress your girlfriend?"" We both felt awkward, and I laughed at him.","[0.3934053055634252, 0.3794296724880796, 0.19263497750257366]",,,

I know he never deserved a second chance, let alone a third, but my foolish heart kept believing he might understand my feelings, just once. Two days back, when I was sick with fever and cold, he came to see me, telling me ""I will pamper you"" and then next day he said he was meeting a friend, and that he'd come back by 7ish but instead returned with hickeys at around 10:30pm. He came with hickeys that I wasn’t supposed to see but I found out, purely by luck. Although, he never told me he loved me, but just showed me enough to make me hope. And maybe that’s what hurts the most, that love felt so close but was never really mine. I cried for hours wondering how I let this happen again, but I don’t even know who to blame, him or myself. I just wanted one last month near him, one quiet goodbye, but he didn’t even wait for that. Now, I want to disappear to a place where no one knows me, where I don’t have to pretend to be strong, where I can finally fall apart without shame. I hope if he ever finds another girl like me, he doesn't abandon her, that he protects her heart and feelings. That he does not become the reason she starts fearing love.","[-0.07709119996746581, 0.08343695584784354, -0.11485678710085565]",,,

He hugged me as he said hello and I felt profoundly held. Across the bar for us were two women, one of whom had brought her chihuahua.

"When I’m walking to work in the morning, I no longer stress about being there on time or what’s awaiting me as soon as I get in. It’s more of enjoying my walk there. I usually take the same route to work. There is a block where I walk on one side of, then I turn right and head down by its other side. This block lights up in my mind as soon as think of my walk to work. It is the intersection of Emerson and Bessie. On this neighborhood, there is a church alongside a few small old fashioned homes, and on the other side are much broader remodeled homes. The church is gated and takes up a half of the block. Behind the black painted wrought iron gate, is a well worked flower garden alongside with a small parking lot and a charming white church. The smaller homes have charm into personalities as well. One’s exterior is renewed with stucco and color block paint scheme. It also has frosted glass with rose accents. Another has steps to a raised cement porch. Not as well cared for as the others, but it does sport multiple of the same American motorcycles in the driveway. Another looks like a Mediterranean home with a roundabout driveway. There is usually a large beige Hummer H2 parked in it. The last one is very quaint with a welled cared for grass lawn, exterior, and details. It has a 1970 VW bug with yellow patina paint and “groovy” flower stickers on the worn areas of the hood.","[0.7108894493352177, 0.3414315606695012, 0.48670512752335343]",,,
"The other side of the block has a minimalist home on the corner with a long green lawn on one’s side of the sidewalk, and brick pavement on the other. Their driveway is also paved with ornate brick pattern. The next house is covered with all sorts of random decorations. From festive holidays to garden frogs and “let it bee 🐝” signs, this house is always changing colors and adornments. Most notable is the large roundly trimmed pine in the middle of their lawn. It always has a tinsel garland wrapped around it. The colors of this garland are changed every now and then. Last transition was from red, white, and blue, to white and gold garland.  Finally, we have the most classic American home to me. Simple house and driveway into a one car garage, but they always have at least one or two restored muscle cars parked in front. One is grey with black accents, the other is red with a black stripe around the tail. Occasionally, there is a street Harley there too. The last house is just a fence around a garden. It seems the home is located on the other street, but they have a recently formed fenced garden on this side of the block. There are some very young fruit trees planted and a very notable Mexican pad cactus in the corner of the fence. This part of my walk is one of my favorite and most notable.","[0.6478510553269012, 0.1360040201241271, 0.3727583171546774]",,,

"Today, I recovered from yesterday’s hard work. I spent the day in bed, resting, taking care, and online “work”. One YouTube video by a man named Dewayne titled “green peas and liver” reminded me that it is important to be on time. Well, about this, I’ve had an email letting me know that there are work documents that have a deadline, but I can only take care of those at the restaurant’s desktop computer. So, today, being reminded that it was the last day to take care of that, I got up, showered and packed some cookies and coffee from yesterday, for breakfast and headed out. I let my manager know, I was on my way. He told me that, we would take care of it tomorrow. I just couldn’t get past the urgent message stating that the 13th was the last day to do it. I thought I’d bring it up again,  but he was very busy, and doing so made him frustrated. Still, he reminded me that tomorrow we would do it. I figured since he’s in charge of me, I could disregard the urgency of the email. So I sat down in the restaurant to eat some cookies. A few of the companies higher ups were sitting on one side of the restaurant and were discussing things in a meeting. I waved to some of them. They waved back. It makes me glad to know that management concerns themselves with the well being of our restaurant. I finished my cookies, and went home. I waved to those who were watchful on my way out.

My boyfriend is usually busy on the weekends, so I take care of the gift buying. Her (our daughter) and I get pretty excited to go to all the garden centers when spring hits. We spent yesterday buying our favorite plants and bonding. We bought my mom a necklace that she picked out, a blanket, a new candle, some perfume, and body washes.... along with the usual flowers and a card. We got his mom some flowers and a fancy salad bowel, and I picked out three cards that he could choose from to give her. I wasn't sure what one he would like for her. He is a pretty simple guy. Meaning he isn't a very affectionate or thoughtful type of person. He doesn't like mushy, heartfelt cards. He is more of a person who will give you a simple card or a funny one. He shows love through actions. I did sneak a heartfelt one for one of the three to choose from. Just in case getting older makes him heartfelt. He will probably stick to the simple one.","[0.5693790491955315, 0.20779883885826878, 0.37217932728847936]",,,

I had a visit with her 2 weeks ago on a Monday to meet her new care provider and her care team. I went off on them a week prior because she was very sick, and I was mad at how she was just left on her own. How I had a very hard time running to another city every week because the place she was living wasn't taking her to the hospital when she was sick. The meeting went well with the new place.

They have staff that is there for each person as an individual, and when my mom gets upset, she takes her out for a walk, to the stores, or to get a coffee.","[-0.4128026904792307, -0.05847451127871322, -0.21018496436578277]",,,

I could tell that they all just ate because the house smelled like chicken. It was refreshing because the last house, I was wondering if they fed her. The smell of food reminds me of a home that cares for the people who are there. To nurture them. There is a difference between someone who is obligated to care for others and a person who truly cares for others. Someone who treats others with respect and care. These people are giving care that is way beyond the obligation. They care for the people they take care of and treat them as they would like to be treated.

She asked me if I lived where she was. I told her no, we are further about an hour and a half away. I told her that she is actually now closer to where her other daughters live.

Her reality still isn't 100%. She told me she heard me saying her name when I was not around. I asked her if I could get a picture with all the pretty dandelions in her hair with her granddaughter.

It was a planter box that I bought specifically just for bringing her flowers. I normally will bring her fresh flowers every time I visit in the summer. I was hopeful I could give her some beautiful tulips and daffodils. When I got home after my visit with her I started to try to get as many seeds planted to make up for it.

Idk I do still think all of it is extremely risky, but I feel we all need to be reasonable. Tariff things that matter, not all goods. I think you should always pick your battles.

I'm not sure anyone's out there at all who would be willing to truly do this like I would. I can accept isolation, then. In the end we're all ultimately alone anyway.

Or perhaps the brief attempt/failure to get a foothold with L in January or February this year was the straw that broke the camel's back.

"If it is, what's changed recently is that I'm not sure it would create such an intimate, loving bond anymore. It's like somehow the idea's become my new normal, even though I'm the only one on Earth that I know of who thinks this way. If everyone were radically honest with each other, no, it would not be seen as so special. It would just be normal. There would probably be people you liked and people you didn't. Why would I think that any random person I do this with would be one of the former and not the latter? It's not about the craving for intimacy anymore. It's simply about the principle of believing that people telling the truth is better. What I envision now, if this ever happens at all, is a series of progressing negotiations and revelations as trust is built.

"Oh, quite rude of me to not introduce myself. I’ll keep my name secret, but call me V. I’m a 17-year-old High School student who wants to share his experience. Many of you might now think I’m arrogant and might be questioning what I can even write that would help you. And it may be true that I’m still naïve and inexperienced, but just maybe my short life experience and the lessons it’s taught me can help someone. I would say it starts quite a while ago, possibly even before I can remember. However, since I can’t really tell that part, I’ll start with what my own brain can tell me. I didn’t have a bad childhood, probably not the best, but not bad for sure. Yeah, my dad had a small drinking problem, but he never got violent. It did sometimes cause my parents to fight, but nothing ever came of it, and I always had my big brother to calm me down when the loud was overwhelming. For a kid born in the digital age I would say I was actually raised very aware of my real-life surroundings. Screens were a rare occurrence in my home, and I got my first phone at the age of 9, and that was because I wouldn’t stop pestering my parents to get me one since my friends started getting iPhones and all those cool touch screen modern gizmos. Even the phone I got was a small LG machine that could barely handle calls, but I’ve gotten side-tracked. My point was that my parents did a good job. Not perfect, but they’re good people and they raised me and my brother as well as they could.","[0.26724717958920763, 0.0013540521388325619, 0.40465310067566124]",,,
"Now to go back a bit, all the way to kindergarten. From the get-go I was marked as capable, and my parents weren’t about to waste that talent. In their eyes they’d been too lenient with my brother and weren’t about to make the same mistake. This meant that while the other kids were working on coloring in shapes and counting to ten I was doing simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Around this time is also when I started exhibiting symptoms of ADHD which I would only get diagnosed a decade later. You remember nap time? I had to be moved to another room because I could never fall asleep. I could never work for more than 15 minutes without getting bored. This was, of course, corrected in ways that most gen Z parents would consider cruel. To come back to the point of this text, at this point in my life happiness came from success and external validation. I know, not a really good start.","[0.05433286635696715, 0.033497713409059444, 0.1944790203053381]",,,

I found it hard to find good friends and I’d been separated from my kindergarten best friend. I didn’t mind being alone that much, I found my solace in good grades and praise. 100%, 10/10, “Well done!”, “Amazing!”. In hindsight I shouldn’t have cared so much, but I was 9 and I was taught I had to be the best. I remember there was a kid everyone used to bully. He was a bit chubbier and nerdier than the average. Unlike me he stood out. That made him an easy target. I remember being really curious about him. I would never confront his bullies or help him in any real way, not yet at least, but I did want to meet him. For secrecy we’ll call him L. L was a kind kid. He was energetic and passionate and really liked history. I kind of considered him my friend, but I was still battling the need to distance myself since I felt like I should focus on getting good grades and working hard. Years 6 – 11 of my life went mostly like this. My priorities unchanged and my happiness coming from other people’s kind words.","[0.3059672377861827, 0.16035825824579084, 0.11211466152734383]",,,
"This started to change around when I was twelve. The turning point was the realization that I didn’t have to put in much effort to get good results in school. I got lazier, my attitude got worse, and the consequences started racking up. For the first time in my life, I decided I was sick of being invisible and I was sick of my only friend getting bullied. I remember vividly punching one of L’s bullies in the hallway after he had sprayed so many meaningless insults my blood pressure started spiking. That punch earned me a swift jab to the jaw. The altercation didn’t evolve further and neither of us was punished. I remember L stopped getting bullied after that. I even gained the bullies respect (I guess). I was finally relaxing a bit. My grades weren’t falling a bit. Finally, I felt like I had a life to live, not just work to do. In this period, I found happiness in my friends and my freedom, and weirdly enough in my brother. He had always been kind, but in this part of my life, I really looked up to him and found comfort in his company. My parents’ relationship only seemed to get worse, which was reflecting on me.

"The last year of primary school was definitely hard. Of course, my grades never dropped. I was still the perfect child, the bright future of the family. High School was approaching, and I was all set to enroll into the most prestigious school in my city, if not my country. Great, no pressure, right? Home life got worse. Mother got a new job which left her working for longer than before, and my father was spending more time with his friends in bars and diners. The arguing became usual. I started wearing my headphones everywhere, around the house and out of it. In school life wasn’t much better. L found a group of kids in our class who were fun, but they were his friends, not mine. Once again, I was left behind. Back to the silence, back to being alone. I remember my music taste changed to reflect this. I used to listen to dad rock mostly (you know, Guns n’ Roses, ACDC, Queen, all that good stuff). In this period, I expanded to a lot of genres. Emo (Pierce the Veil, Yungblud, MCR, …) and metal (Metallica, Iron Maiden, Pantera, Black sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, Alice in Chains, I know this is a lot of rock, but leave me alone) mostly. And a lot of you are looking at your screens in fear right now because a 14-year-old being influences by such role models like Ozzy Osbourne is doomed to experience a downfall.

An iconic pack, advertised on the McLaren MP4/4. The next two years were a slump. I smoked like I would die without it, and I soon started drinking. Short term pleasures that only served to ease my spiraling. Most people are corrupted by their friends, I did it to myself. I only ever smoked my trusty Marlboro reds and I lover liquor and hard alcohol. Bailey’s is expensive so Vodka and Yaeger filled my stomach. The best part? I was too smart to get caught. In this period, I had no real happiness. Short term dopamine from drinking and smoking and spending time at local metal concerts in clubs that were more run down that your average ghetto in Brazil.

I probably would’ve had them if I invested more time into studying. On the first day of school, I sat in the second row on the right when I entered the classroom. All the way up to the wall, trying to blend in with it. A kid who was almost late caught the seat next to me. The next day, first real day of classes, we sat in the same spots because we were both too polite to even think about sitting somewhere different. We kind of awkwardly started talking. We’ll call him F. he was awkward and nerdy, and his voice hadn’t started mutating yet. We were both slow to warm up to each other, but we slowly became friends. He was fun, and he seemed perfect. Almost too perfect. He never swore, he'd never tried a sip of alcohol or even a single smoke. I pretended to be perfect too. That old need for approval taking over again. I needed this kid to like me, he was my only friend. Soon enough I did start changing. I quit smoking and most of the alcohol I drank had become disgusting due to how much I’d abused it. I was coming back to my old nerdy self. I became obsessed with Undertale, Evangelion, Formula 1, and Arcane. I was kind of getting my spark back. That summer F invited me to spend a week with him and his family at the coast.

My parents with each other, my parents with me, me with my brother, I was just surrounded by yelling and arguing. Sure, I was at fault for a lot of it, but I was under pressure to perform something I had no idea how to do. I was pulling my hair day in day out, studying for tests only to be centimeters from perfection. I was frustrated. I wanted to cry but couldn’t. I felt a strong pain in my chest but ignored it every single day because I was stronger than that. And after all that, I managed to have perfect grades.

Thankfully, third grade has yet to prove as academically challenging as the second. In December, when my birthday rolled up, I decided to celebrate it (which is unusual for me).

Prior to the last incident, I called  crisis because I was worried she was going to hurt herself or others. A few hours later, we were where i didn't want things to get. I lost it a little on them. Well, I yelled at them. The cops stayed with my mom for about 10 hours at the hospital until the crisis team came.","[-0.34000942571216525, 0.16891464933870115, -0.1708857127149295]",,,

The doctor had told me they wouldn't do a med wash on her. That they wouldn't place her on her old medications. They were not going to do anything for her. That I need to get used to this being my mom's new baseline, and a lot of family members have a hard time accepting this as the new normal. She expressed that I need to be careful with changing her medications because she had Tardive dyskinesia last time she came there and it was the worest case the doctor seen in 10 year's. A few hours later I recieved a call from county workers in my city. They had requested the phone number for the place she was staying prior because she is court order placed there and to see if she can be returned. I was on my way to work when the call came through. I was angry. They just got off the phone with me and we're placing her back into the community to harm others and herself.","[-0.27537491534255115, 0.04811300975538641, -0.11593797589175889]",,,

Today I had a team's call because they were releasing her now into another place with less people, and more freedom. One on a second floor level. The place before her last one she had tried to get out of a window to run into car's. She broke the staff members arm and that is why she was moved.

So, moving forward my plan is as follows: step one more testing to find out if she has cancer or something else that is causing the weird blood cells counts to be high or low. I need to know if she has an underlying condition. Next I will try with a different doctor to adjust her meds. I am going to switch her to the one's were she was healthy and not mess with the anti psychotic because it can cause her to have Tardive dyskinesia permently. Changing that one isn't worth the risk to her standard of living. I have been researching alot on antipsycotic's and the newest one that doesn't attach to dopamine. It is a new drug, but it might be the best route. Her antipsychotic will be the last one I try to adjust.","[-0.2561601748476497, 0.017706131345946896, -0.13623026262018811]",,,

I do have to admit that I never considered the end of my best friend. If anything i thought something a little more normal. I think most people don't consider this stuff. I knew my mother would leave but I didn't think in this way. Not in a state of suffering for year's and having no quality of life. My heart breaks for her.

"After the voicemails that i had listened to I started to make myself a late dinner. While I was sitting at the table eating, I thought about my mom. I wanted to change my thoughts and I started to look for the book. I had found it. It is titled ""It's Not Supposed To Be This Way"" by Lysa Terkeurst. I skimmed the pages. Sometimes life situations lead you to things you need to find again. Specifically the topic of God not needing us to handle this. He wants us to hand this over to him. I found the book and I didn't know I needed to read it. It is a reminder to me that when trying to help others, maybe I need help too. How I could use a different perspective. To trust the process and when I don't have a good week or when I don't know what is the right answer. To trust that God will guide me to the right answers and a new perspective. Life sometimes sucks, but it doesn't have to be done alone. I need to keep having faith that this will workout because it has to.","[0.0771075273910334, 0.046306003324798686, 0.2133169660822311]",,,
"The voicemails of my mom's voice was a reminder of who she was and who I might be able to support getting back to living a normal life. One where she calls me to tell me of all her tasks she completed. The voicemails were a reminder of who she has the potential to be still. A lady who could call a cab to get her, buy her own groceries, and go to get her hair done. Her voicemails were of the independence she had. I need to keep chugging along and trust God will guide me through this. Even when it might look hopeless, I can't lose hope when the odds are fighting against us. I can accept after I tried everything. Hope isn't lost yet. If it ends up being the end of who she was I will have to trust God in the process as well. Life is short and we all leave the world. Some people just fight to live. My mom never discussed the fight to be normal but I have seen her in her struggles to be normal. When she is normal she lives to the fullest she can. She is normally happy and kind. A beautiful person, no matter the illness she was destined to have. She never was angry at God for it.

I grabbed my shoulder bag and filled it with leather products, a zip bag full of cleaning cloths and shoe brushes, and a pouch full of my daily carry things (knife, flashlight, phone, pry bar, etc). I filled my hands with belts and a three pairs of boots and went to sit out in our front yard on our bench overlooking the west side. It was approaching sunset and I was in the comfort of some shade.

"After brushing off dust and debris from daily use, removing shoelaces and hardware, I began by coating all my leather with Hubert’s shoe grease. I then took some boot wax and brushed some over the exterior of all of the leather goods. I finished up by brushing everything off and reapplying the laces and the belt hardware. I then stopped to admire the work of my hands. This would be the first time I wax any kind of leather. It wasn’t as glossy as say a shined dress boot, but I also didn’t completely follow traditional methods. I brushed the waxed leather without adding droplets of water to the brush. Either way, the leather looked much more wet and glossy, which is what I was among for. Although in the Reddit comments there are mixed opinions about how often it is good to condition leather, I still found that with mid-frequent oiling, I would still get leather that looked a bit too dry for my liking. Some people let it go like that without problems, but I appreciate my other boots that look cared and glossy, and that’s what I was aiming for. I took some photos and shared to my instagram.

I propped up my phone on its stand and watched the “Alone Australia” series on Netflix, while eating pizza. While enjoying, a message came through that my manager was going to need me later.

I grabbed my bag and work gear and left. When I got there, they were all busy with the food orders.

I asked him if he was okay with milk and he pretty much rejected most dairy, except ice cream.

Usually, street tacos are sold for a dollar a pair, so naturally, their portion is tiny. That would make sense, why our street chalupas are mini sized. While waiting for my food, a customer came in. Very polite guest. He asked to wash his hands. Said he finished up from a basketball game. He placed his order and chatted with our staff. He said he came from the east coast.

"She told me it stems from being in situations where I felt unsafe to be happy. Unsafe or unjustified when celebrating. Somebody - or some people - made me feel like it was inappropriate to show joy. Perhaps I had to wait for the second shoe to drop, like there was an asterisk behind the ""good thing"", or the joy was ripped from me shortly after experiencing it.

This is evident because they're already clawing at the surface. The grass that I tried to grow above their graves is rotting. The pretty foliage I planted to obscure the burial mounds won't bloom.

Everyone is able to empathize with the community and have an understanding and joy at the same time. I bet it is amazing to spend time together all understanding the same spiritual struggle and having endurance. It has to be a very joyous experience.

I haven't braided any hair in a very long time, probably since my daughter was younger. When I was very little, my mom taught me how to braid. I was very fast at braiding, so fast that it is hard to see my fingers moving. Braiding must be like riding a bike because I felt my fingers going so fast between her thin hair strands.

I started gluten-free bread ( 2 loaves)and added honey to the batter. That had to sit for an hour to rise before baking. I put that to the side and started massive chopping onions. I needed four onions. I made chicken noodle soup with only white meat, used the dark meat for chicken salad,  made a tuna salad with dill, pickles, and some crapers, and made beef stroganoff. All of it was homemade. I cut the loaves up so my mom could make sandwiches for a few days with the tuna and chicken salad. The chicken noodle soup she could warm in the microwave. I told her the stroganoff she will need to freeze and pull out later.

I do have leftover carrots, but that will be okay. It isn't that many. I know the chicken noodle and stroganoff can be frozen, and the tuna and chicken salad can last three days. She has a lot of food with what I packed her with. Plus, she should have rice and potatoes still at the house because she didn't get into that yet. I bought a lot of that last  week foe sides for her. She should be good for a while.

Not sure how to handle the misunderstanding, I tried explaining from my point of view. Once again, she said that we could have been eating already and pointed to the clock. All I said was that I knew she was off at 10pm and I wanted to be ready, for anything. I wasn’t sure if she had anything in mind though. She didn’t suggest anything, so I offered once again to go out to eat. Finally, we were on our way. We stopped at Popeye’s for sandwiches. It was getting close to her curfew so, we took them to go. She dropped me and I waited for her to video call so we could eat together. When she called she started unpacking. I just waited, patiently (I was hungry though). When it came time, I was excited to eat. We ate and went to bed. We talked and disagreed with each other about the next time we would be able to see each other.

"Today, I woke at around 2pm to my friend D’s video call. She saw that I was sleeping and asked me to call her back once I had finished. I didn’t fall back asleep, but remained in a dreamlike state. Finally, I came to and decided to check the accumulated messages from the time I was sleeping. Not much. Afterwards, I called back. She was especially resentful today. I just remained quiet. I think she was feeling insecure about us and was projecting her frustrations. I think not returning any of that made her feel better. Anyway, she said she had stuff to do and that she would come by at 7pm. She mentioned going out to eat, so I mentioned hot wings. Sweet and sticky chicken wings were on my mind. I know she is picky about where to eat so I let her decide. When she hung up, I got to doing all of the things I wanted to from the previous day. My small laundry basket was more than full so, I threw a load. I also picked up the futon and all the bedding from the floor to let it all air out. I wiped the restroom, swept the floor, and reorganized my wardrobe. It feels like the cold days are behind us, so I put way all my sweats and winter gear.

Apparently, she had decided to go to a restaurant I invited her to about a month ago, finally. She was pressuring me because they closed at 8pm. I remained calm. It took me about 10 minutes to grab an outfit and shower well. I brushed my teeth and grabbed my bag and a hoodie on the way out. So, we were off. She drove very well today. Before we went inside, I let her know that we could look at the menu and if she didn’t find anything, we could always look somewhere else. She remained firm and we headed inside. It took us a while but I found a drink called strawberry dream (I wasn’t too hungry) and she settled for an appetizer of popcorn chicken. My drink came out first. It was blended strawberry on the bottom half and a thick crushed ice and cream on the top. I tried both individually. I then enjoyed stirring it. It was resistant to combine. She seemed to enjoy my playing. When I let her try it, she mentioned she didn’t like it. Then her popcorn chicken came out. It was served with ketchup, but all the sauces and chili oil were on the side of our table. She seemed to enjoy my company more than her food.

Anyways my mom is the only person living there. They rent the place. Have 24-hour staff. They supply the food, rides to Dr appointments, and her washing supplies. Rent around here is $600 to $1,000. This means they're clearly in the negative. There is no way they're not. You can't pay 24-hour staffing on $1000 a month. No one I know can live on $1000 a month in this economy, and now, if you split that for 3 employees, it isn't adding up.

She could have gone sepsis if I didn't take her to the hospital. The place is supposed to bring her in if she isn't seeming okay. They didn't, and I did. I knew something was off. It takes an hour to get to where she is. We had a team's call on Wednesday to discuss future care. They want to keep her there. I told them that we need to discuss this team understanding that if she is not seem okay, she needs to be brought in and the signs of a UTI because it causes medications not to work properly. They were going to give my mom a 30-day notice. I expressed how this isn't the best for my mom to be an hour away. How I want her placed in our town where she is from. That is my goal. I explained how her friends and family are in this town. Her doctors are here.","[-0.1165387408363587, 0.010568600899601656, -0.03440742039480983]",,,
"Right now, she is stable. I made an appointment for next Monday to have her checked out to see if she still had the UTI. She didn't. I called for a physiatrist appointment. That situation is a dumpster fire as well because she is a legal resident of the town I am in and resides in the town she has been placed in. Long story short, even though she is in a different county than our court fileing and living there, doctors will not see her because she isn't a legal resident of that county. It's just a mess. Her doctor wanted her check for cancer because they assumed she had it in 2023. They refused to see her until I got her checked. I was pretty pissed to find out that all these people suspected she was sick and no one did anything. I got those tests ran as well on that Monday the 10th. I have a scheduled evaluation in June. It's a long wait, but it is all I have at this point. They wanted a 1.5-hour evaluation before any meds were adjusted. Mental health, in my opinion, is madness.

I went to the hospital on Saturday to get medicine because I had an appointment for my mom on Monday the 10th, and I couldn't have an infection. I got meds. I saw the dentist on the 12th.

"Today I woke up, because my friend had a gynecologist appointment. I offered to accompany her. She said she would pick me up at 8:15am. We woke up early.  I FaceTimed her to keep track of when she got up and she was coming. We both showered and dressed business casual, today.  My outfit consisted of sandstone colored polo, muted pine green chinos, and brown leather boots. I threw on a warm black denim jacket, a wool watch cap, black leather belt and watch, and grabbed my brown canvas messenger bag. I hurried as I saw she was almost to where I lived. I grabbed a drink and headed out the door. She arrived a few minutes later. I got in her car and we were off. She kept yawning and complaining she was tired. When we got there, I sat down while she filled out paperwork. During the wait, I was really restless, but energetic. I took selfies with her, I played games on my phone, I listened to music, and comforted her about her lack of sleep.

All that talking for nothing!""","[0.10940641275007963, 0.0121759793313233, 0.13887461345208602]",,,

I took some oranges and a lemon and put them in my bag for juice, later. I went inside and began prepping the house for some cleaning. My cat was the door seeking food and snacks.

I then started to break down all of the notifications and die coded to do it in bed, because my house was really cold and now I’m here, writing in my journal.","[0.442198134838139, -0.059316289590772536, 0.15061943644373613]",,,

"🤔 Today, was more of a day off. I woke up and ate pizza. Garlic and spinach were the toppings. I really liked the garlic, but spinach pizza tasted bland. Some seasoning would have helped. Anyway, I caught up on subscriptions and messages. Todays highlights were Jeremiah Craig doing a review on some army green Gustin denim jeans. He paired them with a bunch of different boots. Well, I took note and used what I learned as inspiration for my outfit. I needed to get my cat some food and treats. I also advantage of the warm afternoon weather to wash and hang dry laundry. After visiting my local favorite store (dollar tree), I picked up a few wet cat food trays and some different treats. I also grabbed myself something to drink. I walked home and my dad was here. He was cooking dinner in the kitchen. He moved to the living room, while I prepared a tray of food and treats for my cat, who was patiently waiting outside. I sat in the sunset with my cat, while he ate and just sat back and listened to Jeremiah Craig’s album: Gardener hands. When my cat finished, I went inside to sit with my dad int he loving room.

"Today, I woke up and had pizza for breakfast. Then, I joined my dad in the living room. He was watching Netflix. I brought my edc folding knife, all of it’s tools, and maintenance kit with me. My plan was to disassemble it for a good cleaning and lubrication. I’ve tried disassembling it before, but I stripped the screw trying to undo it. I stopped, because I was afraid to ruin the knife. But yesterday, John Evan’s of JuhVon’s knife flicks YouTube channel offered a video guide of him disassembling his spyderco for general maintenance. He was so smooth with his, he inspired me to try to tackle the disassembly of mine. I would love to have a clean knife like his.","[0.4519800143527042, 0.24457039441797312, 0.21377012610296006]",,,
"So, while tinkering with my knife in dad’s living room, my dad got up and showered. He was getting ready in the background, while I was busy carefully wrestling with the screws and the stubborn loctite. He came by and he told me, he was going somewhere, if I would like to go with him. Since I had the day off, I put all my stuff away, grabbed a dress pair of clothes and jumped in the shower. I got ready fast and packed my bag. On went my boots and I took a lined trucker jacket for the cold. We got in the truck but when he went to crank it, it wouldn’t start. I proceeded to think of all the reasons why a car wouldn’t start, but did turn over. I pointed out the fuel pump, or to check the spark plugs for spark. He went to the fuel filter and started to take it off. It not being my truck, just kind of stepped aside and followed along. My dad has less orthodox methods for fixing cars. I would take parts off to make accesing work area easier. He contorted his arms and tools, around tight spaces. It looked very unpleasant to me. Finally I suggested that he at least remove the wheel, so I would have to hug a tire in order to take apart a fuel line, behind it. Well, he seemed more adept at disassembling his truck, so while he was working, I once again pulled out my knife and tools and started jimmying the screws. I stripped some of them. They were hard to break loose. Like, the entire knife was harder to disassemble than it ever should have to be. I can’t complain much.","[-0.08943156165439031, 0.04135395989490746, -0.014882436933470473]",,,

"Once I got it undone, I set it aside and would go back and forth. I would help my dad with the goal of removing his fuel filter and I would come back to wipe and clean my knife parts. Eventuall, I was able to clean all of it and start piecing the knife together. With only one video tutorial worth of experience, I had fun understanding the design and how it goes together. Eventually, my dad and I, finished removing the filter. So we proceeded to take an uber to the auto parts store, to get a replacement. I explored their micro toolkits while he purchased the part. We then had to walk home because the uber was a one way. I don’t mind walking at all. I don’t even have a car. It’s my main mode of transportation. We enjoyed our walk home, then started putting the truck back together. Once assembled, the truck would not turn over. We tried messing with all of the connectors. I was baffled, because first we had a mechanical issue, but how did we end up with an electrical problem. We were both pretty hungry at this point, so I suggested going out for food. We left that there and when to my local pizzeria to bring back a pizza. I enjoyed walking with my dad. He is very chatty. He also walks, way fast. He acknowledged, but he said it’s not forced. Everyone else seems to agree with us. When he walks, it appears as if he is in a hurry to get somewhere.","[0.719108975922477, 0.42631021958728643, 0.4644532494486122]",,,

"My dad was ready to call it a night, but I reminded him if he was going to walk tomorrow or how he was going to get to work. So we tried once again, to figure out why the engine wasn’t cranking when turning the key. My dad disassembled the starter and we looked at it. He noticed, one of the pins from the connector was bent to the side. I missed the possibility of that completely! My dad used a screw driver to bend it back into place and after struggling with the reassembly, it still wasn’t t right. I check the connection and found the pin wasn’t in all the way. I did it by “feel” but once I felt it was in, we tried the starter again and this time, it cranked. Still though, no start. I suggested we pull the spark plug off to check for spark, so we did. After testing, there was no spark. I thought about it being the ignition coils, since the truck is not carbureted. He pointed out the timing chain could be broken. One is easy to check, the other is a major repair (not something that breaks easily). Either way, it was getting really late and my dad needed to go to bed. I forgot he had work in the morning. So he left it, for another day. We spoke for a while inside and he dismissed me. We said goodnight and now I’m in my bedroom watching subscriptions and sharing about my day on social media.","[-0.08389260455404599, 0.02009945359053037, 0.021228468773008047]",,,

Today I picked a “vintage” black button up (think: pirate and loose sleeves flapping in the crosswind). That, along with my washed black tapered, denim jeans. I settled for barefoot style walking shoes in black because boots seemed excessive. To finish it off, I wore my felted black wool watch cap. I then had two slices of veggie pizza for breakfast and white grape/ strawberry juice energy drink. I packed my backpack with packages. Since I was already in the same plaza, I took my collection of reusable plastic bags to recycle, my wallet, phone, and a water bottle. I was set to go. I looked around my room to make sure it was tidy before leaving. I washed an empty water pitcher and cleaned a dinner plate. I then took out the room trash bag and an empty pizza carton. My cat was outside waiting, so I grabbed his treats and food and fixed him a plate. One final look over and I was satisfied. I left, only to be shortly stopped by my neighbor. He greeted me and asked me for $20. He said times were tough and he needed to pay bills. I gave him $15 that I had on me. He also recognized that I’ve helped him in the past and would like to give back, somehow. We chatted for a while. Afterwards, he let me go and asked me to be safe out there.

Someone had said that if I were to get married, I should find a woman that suffered well.

At this point, my daddy was pulling into the driveway with his pickup. I started to check all of my unread notifications on my phone. One of those was an announcement that my package had arrived. I proceeded to inspect the box and did find an attached slip on the other side with my name and address. I greeted my dad and we chatted for a bit. He started fixing his dinner while I opened the package and showed him my new, used boots. He brought up the idea of having too much and depopulating to make up for it, but I told him that I’m committed to the things I bought and will likely use them up before going out for new or better options (lessons learned).

Pizza, peach grape juice, and a grilled cheese burrito kept me until I woke up at about ten a.m. afterwards, I had my caffeine and I got up to clean the house. I started with washing some boots that I purchased online, but were used. I thought a good wash would get them ready for som leather conditioner, because they were beat and worn down. Once I put them out to dry, I came back inside and started prepping my house for a grand sweep and mop. First, the bed sheets and mattress were folded up and placed on top of my library chair; out of the way. Then I organized my closet. Both my storage and my clothing. I moved some spring weather clothes to storage and reorganized my most used pieces, for future use. I picked out an outfit for later this day, since I figured I’d go out to pick up something to drink and dinner. Then I brought out the cleaning sprays and got to wiping all of the glass in the house. Then, I moved on to clean the inside of the bathroom, wipe the door handles, and light switches. Once that was clean, I swept the floor and threw out the dust. All the while, I was gathering all of the laundry into the washing machine. Today, the pillow case was included. I then got up to date on my messages in my phone. After that short break, I then started mopping all of the hard floors. Once I finished, I was due for a shower.

On my way, I passed by Taco Bell. Evelyn was at the window taking orders today. I then picked up my things and went home. At this point, I was really hungry, so I ordered pizza. I left to pick it up, but something happened and I was waiting for 45 minutes. I had asked if they had gotten my order. He said they had to remake it. 🤷 I was running late at this point.

"Today, I woke up without breakfast to eat, but I figured I’d let nature take its course. Once I got truly hungry, I would go out to bring something home. Until then, I remained in bed and on my phone for a completely lazy day. At about 2 in the afternoon, all of the food recipe shorts on YouTube started to hit pretty heavy. I finally acknowledged my hunger and ordered a pizza through the app. I proceeded to set the pick up time at about an hour from my order time. This gave me time to shower and change into better clothes. My logic is that if people are working hard to make my food, the least I can do is come in clean and presentable and not in pajamas to pick it up. So I got ready and left to the pizzeria. When I got there however, the cashier was telling me that they had no orders. I was confused. I did remember placing an order. I wondered if I completed it, because apparently, there was no order in their register. The lady was kind enough to let me use Wi-Fi to look up an order in my app. I didn’t have any record of an order. So I just replaced the order with an ASAP pickup time. She allowed to me sit and wait while they made my pizzas. I passed the time by playing Mob Control game on my phone. After about 14 minutes, the cook exclaimed “your order is done.” I jumped out of my chair, pushed the seat in, and thanked them as I grabbed my pizzas. I then walked home and placed my pizzas in the room. The only one who was home was my mom.","[-0.10156695557179769, 0.18116734512601307, -0.00867218941312107]",,,

It was interesting. We then got home and got caught up in a little bit of sister drama. Someone has stolen the wheel off of her boyfriend’s Mercedes, which she parked in the corner of our neighborhood (not ideal). Couldn’t do much other than speculate why anyone would bother, so we went inside and I proceeded to setup my dumbbells for some weightlifting. A workout after all that pizza would do me good. I drank from a pitcher of lemon iced tea, while watching YouTube videos from my subscriptions. Then Dad came over and we had a talk about working out. So we slightly worked out together,  but mine was more spread out and would be for far longer. After fixing his dinner (fish today), he invited me to watch a movie with him. I politely, refused. “I will continue my workout.” So I did. Back and forth, weights and YouTube. Then my dad mentioned how he got an eviction order from court.

Woke up at my place. Fully clothed and in my bed. No recollection of how I got here. Start piecing it together. I Uber home so that's good. My drunk text to one friend was literally incomprehensible.

I sent you an apology and you said it's fine but don't expect you to not be a bitch. I clearly have feelings there that I need to move past so I need to let that go. I hope I can get my hoodie back it's one of my favorite. Nothing else to do so I had back to the bar. Sit there gossip about all the bullshit that happened last night. Apparently I was not the only one in a bad state. There is a punk fest down the road. I take my one friend wife over since she wanted to check out.

"Out of all the times I can only recall two of them, one of which happened two days ago. The first was when I was about sixteen. I was traveling with the bus from school back home. A girl in the bus caught my attention. Now in this case looks definitely were part of it, because yes, she looked super friendly, but she also was an emo/scene girl, something I have always found an amazing look. She and (I assume) her mom got off the bus, and I thought I was confident enough to go and talk to her, so instead of staying in the bus for another 2 stops home, I got out as well. As soon as my foot hit the floor, my confidence was gone. I decided to walk home. The street I took home was parallel to the main street. I always look around, and in one of the streets linking the street I was on with the main street, I caught another glimpse of this girl. She caught me looking, which boosted a little bit of the confidence back into me. One street further, the same thing happened, again boosting my confidence. Sadly, the street after, I didn’t catch her anymore. And instead of actual trying to go after her, just to say ‘hi’, I walked home thinking about the scenarios that could have been. In the weeks that followed I tried to find her online, but without success. At some point I messaged a friend of a friend, because she looked very familiar, but sadly it wasn’t her.","[-0.5054328760464929, -0.10001989625066765, -0.2499771129089304]",,,

"And last Wednesday, it sure happened again. I was working at our Amsterdam office, about 200 kilometers from home. The office has been decorated with many green walls, flowers and trees all over the building. Somewhere around 10 I had a meeting, so I went into a small cubical and sat down for the call. This cubical, fully made of glass, has a perfect view of the hallway in which we have our small kitchen island with the coffee machines and with some of those plants. As I sat there focused on the meeting, I saw a guy walk to the plants to water them. A few seconds later a girl entered my sight and something about her just made me lose all focus and stare. I really hate this, as it sounds creepy as hell. But I couldn’t get my eye of her. She had a badass appearance; someone I’d guess rides a motorcycle. She had some tattoos and looked very independent and like someone that would stand her ground. At this point the guy in the meeting had mentioned me a couple of times trying to get back my attention. The girl looked at me as she was walking away, and as I was still staring, she looked straight into my eyes. Instead of looking away, I just kept eye contact. She probably thought what a weirdo, but she kept eye contact for a good five seconds, before she was out of sight.

I went to the one close to me on the balcony, as that was one with oat milk which I actually like better. Grabbed my coffee and just enjoyed some me-time with my coffee looking over the ground floor where people were still enjoying their lunch. At some point I looked down, and there she was again.

It's my fault. 27 years of patience, waiting for the golden opportunity to finally actualize and spring forth from the chaotic hellscape that is the consequences of my actions. I was so desperate for an escape that I became a chore to endure. She didn't want to be my savior, nor did she want to be saved. She wanted a lover and best friend that could stand on their own two feet so she could finally let hers rest, and I couldn't. I'm out of practice, out of touch, and out of will. I really was built to be alone, as I'd always suspected. Even another lost one couldn't tolerate me for long. A woman who understood exactly what I'd been through, exactly how dark it could get, and in dire need of a helping hand shoved me away. It gnaws at me. It's not a split second decision that sent it all to Hell, it was months of concentrated effort by the both of us. An unintentional conspiracy. In acceptance, there is no relief.

"Today started slownly. It was like slowly approaching doom bht still. I spent like 3 hours to train on other hard task which made my mind melt completely so 1h before exam I just had a nap. After nap, I went (together with circa 100 people) to face the exam and either win or die. So ""why did you died"" You propably start asking. It was simple. Before everything phd ordered us to leave our phones turned off on windowsill. Then he checked them with kind of wave detector and summoned those who did not turn off their phones. When our electronics was disabled (not so sure how it would help if we could use it, but ok) he showed us the exam: one task. I started looking at it with the face like democrats in the US when they saw the last election results. Started doing it. Working on it. Unsure about everything I peeked the people in front of me: they are counting but even seeing their backs I saw their uncertainty. I looked to the left: my friend had a face like it was his first time having such an objective. Looked to the right. Other friend stertedceating his pen and last braincell with it. 10 minutes before end I just crossed my legs and streched myself across the chair. There was nothing I could do.

All day. We text all day. It doesn't matter what we are doing it's non stop. As the countdown gets closer to 0 my anxiety is rising. I wasn't having a great day but you managed to cheer me up without even knowing it. I had nothing but meetings and you had a packed schedule but the texts kept flowing. You were so hungry today and I was able to score a pair of tickets to NIN. I was hoping you'd ask who I was taking so that I could say you. You got off before me and had some running around to do. But you text the whole time and sent me to beautiful pictures of the sunset. You mentioned you were helping test and set-up the screen for the super bowl party. And that after you might stop by. You might stop by. Singular. I was a few beers in when you showed up and wrapped me in a hug from behind. Gave me a big squeeze. Your hand lingering and dragging across my chest. Then I turned around and he was there. You guys are trying to work it out. I was devastated but I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but good thoughts for both of you. Selfishly I'm crumbling inside. Apparently people are talking and trying to figure out who's doing who. So says our one bar friend but she's nuttier than me so who knows. She did say that he was staring at me a few times.

This is the biggest issue I have identified in the last year. We are expected to devote 45-55 hours a week into a career that will have a negligible net benefit to anything long term and ultimately takes us away from the people and places where we genuinely want to spend our time.

You are going to a baby shower in a beautiful pink dress. I wish I could have seen. Plans to meet up at the bar and watch your team. I'm getting there early with another of our friends to hold some seats. Finally able to catch up with someone that I went off on a few weeks back. We reconcile which was awesome because I didn't know that was a source of tension for the group. We watch the game and I try and give you space. I get invited to our friends house after. You are there. I leave a little early because I have an early meeting the next day. You ask me to text when I'm home. I do and then say goodnight. You assume I'm being an asshole and that I have to be ok with who you hang with. Why do I have to be ok with anything. You made it clear we are not together. You can do whatever you want. And even if we were together I'm not a shallow rule setting guy. I love you for who you are I wouldn't want that to change. I can feel my mask slipping back on. If I don't push these feelings down they will consume me again. I was so close to the end last time.,"[0.5408861588226378, 0.31053455983658357, 0.15929700188809573]",,,

"She lays in bed with a heavy heart, one that she numbs each night but still feels aching beneath the distractions. She is so sure of herself yet so unsure at the same time. In moments she feels that she knows herself to her very core. That although she couldn't put it into words, she understands the world around her and exactly how she fits in it. In the very same moment, she feels there is no place for her. No space where she belongs. That even she cannot understand herself, like a foreign part of her exists and occupies a space within her soul. She questions how these realities can occur simultaneously, how she can love and hate so deeply. How she can know everything and nothing at once. Some nights she wishes she didn't know so much. That she could be one of those people who spent their days gliding along a superficial layer of ice. She wonders if they ignore the cracks in the ice for their own comfort or if they just don't see them at all. Part of her wishes she could live that way, but she cannot. She sees deep beneath the layers, sometimes deep enough that it frightens her and contributes to her aching heart. But sometimes, she swims deep enough to see that her fear was all an illusion. That all parts of herself were pieces of an elaborate yet simple puzzle.","[-0.17314104984176806, 0.0589476153253219, -0.09885383865708007]",,,

However, we both know distance is not the issue here. The issue is, once again, I carve something I cannot have, someone that does not crave me the same way. And so, I let this “thing” take over my body and mind, in hopes that things will change, but they never do.

"I need to vent somewhere before I go crazy. And honestly not sure why I'm doing it here but maybe I need validation that I'm not the only one who feels this way or something idek. I'm just all over the place. My job sucks. I'm scared to leave it cause the amount I get paid right now is nice with my bills and whatever but not knowing what I'll be able to get other places is stressing me out. Especially having a house and one of my biggest fears is not being able to afford it and then losing it. But recently things have been much more difficult to deal with and I'm having a lot of anger towards... well a lot of people that don't deserve it and it's not fair. For either party. And it's the little things too which is so frustrating. So I got married in November to a wonderful man but there seems to be a disconnect between us and it's not anything that would end in divorce or anything drastic but there's no honeymoon phase. There's nothing. I think a lot stems from my depression but it's also hard.. cause we're living with 2 other people. They're my best friends and I've been living with them since 2018. Then I met my now husband in 2019. Long story short, we bought a house together and they moved in with us cause they couldn't afford to live on their own. It's hard out there.

Fast forward to today and my one friend (let's call her Friend A) recently got into a relationship. He was over at our house for a week during Christmas and then every weekend since then. How is it fair that when I was dating my husband, it wasn't okay for him to spend time with me but now that she's with someone, it's not a big deal?? Of course I haven't said anything and I'm not sure I even will cause what is it actually gonna change? Friend A and I... we seem to butt heads a lot. Like sisters really. The other friend who lives with us (Friend B) seems to always have to be the mediator between us but I told her about my issues and she apologized for it which was nice but I can't shake the feeling that if I try to talk to Friend A about it, it'll become a fight or things might be taken the wrong way. I say that because she's very quick to be triggered and always feels attacked when we try to confront her about things. So talking to her is hard. I feel the stuff is in the past so why dwell on it? Why not just let it be? For some reason it bothers me that I wasn't treated the same way when I first was dating my husband. Call it jealously or whatever.

We keep an electric heater on outside cause we have a lot of cats we can't take inside so we try to keep them warm. That's most likely where the power drain is coming from. We then also agree that we need to be more mindful about leaving lights on in the house and whatever. Okay sure. Not a problem. But I come home from work and go to our room to shed the work day from my being, and come back out to a dark living room and Friend A just sitting on the couch in the dark. I'm like why do you keep turning the lights off?! Like I'm out and about in the living room.. don't wanna be in the dark. Didn't think we were being that crazy about the lights now. I turn the light on and she's complaining that she's got a migraine. Ok fine. I'm already annoyed with the day so I just turn it off and leave. The problem here is that she does this everytime she's got a migraine. I understand they aren't easy to deal with. It sucks. I get it. But it's not okay to come out and basically inconvenience everyone else in the house every time cause you are dealing with it.

Which one is best for us both. I sent you a song this morning. I love that I get up so much earlier than you do. Then I worry that I'm over loading your texts. You text me as soon as you wake up. I'm in a meeting but don't care and a smile lights my face as I see your name. Someone in the meeting noticed I don't care I already completed my presentation. You kind of ignore things said last night saying it's a new day. That makes me worry. I ask for your opinion about an upcoming meeting with my wife. We've been separated for 8 months and initially we bonded because we are both going through extended break ups. She's coming to meet me soon and initially I thought it would be to discuss our status.

I'm going to do a '12 Months of' project for both kids (private collection, I don't post my kids online ever, too many creeps. Sorry) and both of the dogs (will be publicly posted at some point). As depression set in, the passion for photography died down and so did the action of taking pictures. The fact I'm having the urge to do that again isn't something I am going to ignore.","[0.021426520569598775, 0.10924093159405864, 0.04965801200973489]",,,

"Its difficult to explain but i'll try. There's this feeling people get when something in their life hits them hard enough. So its like whenever they are going to repeat an action , their mind or heart screams at them to not, to change their ways , to become a little different. And it mostly starts from some particular incident which leaves some kind of burning wound in your heart.Its a similar feeling to  when someone betrays you and you wants revenge and you have this sensation that you can't stop and you need to do everything to get a step closer. I am not very sure if people understand this feeling but i have met some people who have experienced it. I also went through a similar one about a month or two ago, it came over a trivial issue but still reminds me not to do something. Yesterday night , i realized that if i could get the same feeling to change over and become better , i may be able to evolve my mindset and live a better life. The only problem remains that this feeling doesn't just come over at will. incidents trigger this and mostly the unpleasant ones. I am trying to remember bad things in life so that maybe there could be a chance i may get the same feeling change for a better reason. I don't want to live life as i have been living. I want to change but my will is still weak enough to not put efforts to achieve what i desire.","[-0.13433143557370547, 0.08227394269349365, 0.18708022613686112]",,,

I contributed by paying 150 pesos for the costumes and other things that will be used for the competition.","[-0.09287363501950556, 0.012688216006509124, 0.030233831867673006]",,,
"As for me, some of my classmates were also not included. I was browsing around Shopee and tried to search for a Microsoft Office license key. I know this might not be good and could be illegal, considering it’s a volume license. However, you know you’ve got to do what you’ve got to do. Since I’m just a Grade 12 student, I’m not earning any money, and I really need Microsoft Office, such as Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.","[-0.22001285761186803, 0.05315425258186302, -0.019702640995407087]",,,
"The one I found on Shopee was selling for only 75 pesos. That was probably discounted because it’s December, so there are a lot of discounts and vouchers for the upcoming Christmas. So, yes, I bought that for 75 pesos with my GCash and installed it. I clicked the link on my laptop. At first, I was obviously hesitant to click, but based on the reviews on the Shopee app about that product, they were positive. It had over 2,500 sold nationwide, so I was pretty confident that it was legitimate. Imagine 2,000 sales—that’s a lot, and pretty much the majority of the comments were positive; I didn’t see any negative comments about it.","[0.5179504427836097, -0.022470876639601973, 0.5669725300407359]",,,
"So, that’s what I did. I installed it on my computer. The process was that after I bought the license, they sent me an email with steps on how to install it, and of course, they also provided the product key for Microsoft Office 2024. I followed the steps. My computer already had Microsoft Office installed when I got it; however, I uninstalled it since it wasn’t the right version, and the download link provided by the seller had Microsoft Office 2024 on it.","[0.11149074841678518, -0.0028625034486017492, 0.14398540171430585]",,,
"I downloaded it to my computer; it’s the latest Microsoft Office program. After I opened Microsoft Office 2024, I went back to the email and copied the product key that was provided. The product key is the most important part—that’s what I paid for with that 75 pesos. So, yes, I copied the key and pasted it into my account settings in Microsoft Word. I was scared at that time, considering how cheap it was. Originally, if you were to buy the real license for Microsoft Office 2024, it would cost you about $100 or even $200, which in the Philippines is around 5,000 to 15,000 pesos. So, it’s very expensive, and considering I got it for only 75 pesos (about $1), that is absolutely ridiculous.","[-0.4481061070273562, 0.45582832425706804, -0.14699996525056713]",,,
"However, miracles happen, and this absolutely worked. Although when I checked the license information, it stated that it had a volume license. I understand that a volume license is when a company or organization buys Microsoft Office in bulk, allowing them to use the same product key on multiple computers. So, that’s probably what the seller did—either the seller stole the keys and sold them or the seller themselves had the volume license and shared or sold it online, since you can use the same product key on every device or computer.","[0.3957867840398609, 0.02062705092491613, 0.4128279709435398]",,,
"Now I understand why it was so ridiculously cheap. I know this is very wrong; however, I’m not a professional yet and cannot afford a one-time fee for Microsoft Office. Also, Microsoft 365 is not sustainable for me, since you have to pay around $10 or 500 pesos per month, and I just cannot sustain that for the long term. So, I really had to do this just to get basic Microsoft Office and Excel.","[-0.37906083603746193, 0.08936474320354343, -0.011488818206733127]",,,

"So I'm learning about commercial real estate and a little bit of finance, and what I've relied is that all of these complicated ways to go about things are created for everyone to be able to make a little bit of money.. Because everyone has to make money in our capitalistic society. But if we just got rid of capitalism, then there would be no need for all of these structures, and people could just trade labor and not need to “make money”... The point of these intricate manipulations of moving parts is just to create more opportunity to move money around in a way that gets people involved a little bit more than they had before….. You have to work really hard, devoting your time and energy moving through these systems in order to squeeze out your drops of money. All finance is, seems to be just moving a bunch of really detailed pieces around, rearranging them in a way that has to be learned, so that by their made-up logic, more money comes out at the end. It's like finance making up its own laws of math or physics. It says; if I do I take all of these pieces and get everyone involved and make rules about all of these little pieces and then shuffle them then that means that POOF there's more money out the end of our little equation game! I have a lack of facilities when it comes to my mental processing, but this is my current, however probably flawed, feeling about it so far.","[0.12843109220088406, 0.0030246595025454604, 0.16341412885675446]",,,

"I feel that my life has no purpose right now. I just graduated with my Batchelors degree after going to school for YEARS (I switched degrees, took breaks, and was taking one class at a time while working full time.) I feel that I should be happy and ready to move on to a career that I study for but it's a field I've never been in except for school. I currently work for my city and actually have a chance of being in management at the beginning of next year but I'm uncertain in what career path I should choose. I know my current job really well and will get paid well/good benefits if I stay but I have a chance of greater pay with the other career path. The other career path is uncertain though and I know very little from school alone and I'm afraid of switching, failing, and loosing my other opportunity. I'm feeling a little lost and that if I don't use my degree I worked so hard for is going to waste. With this uncertainty I've ended up doing nothing and just waiting until next year. Without having school anymore I'm struggling to find a new purpose and spend more of my time doing nothing at home which makes me feel lazy. Is this normal? Am I being overdramtic?

I think I'm definitely doing great, and these accomplishments of course add up to my mental health, to feeling better. I think l'm in a great healing journey. I'm not rushing anything, that's what I keep telling myself. ""You're not in a rush."" Today, I woke up, oil pulled, brushed my teeth, washed my face, ate my breakfast and drank my lemon water. I decided in the morning to put my phone away and not use it until a certain time, I put a timer for it. During this waiting time I decided to do some stretching exercises and meditation.

I was just feeling at peace in that very moment, as it was night and the swing was swinging a very tiny bit each time together with the wind, the moon was full and shiney, the little flowers were dancing in the night lights and I was hearing the voices of the people that were talking in the background, the little children playing, the sound of a football being hit, and the crickets chirping in sync. It was a nice moment to take in,  yet, I'm still not even sure if I was really able to take in that moment. Cause all I felt like was that I had to focus very hard and think about everything to take in the moment, or photograph and film everything to remember these things and turn them into nice memories.  Because I feel like I have become incapable of naturally taking in delightful memories and remembering them the way you would remember the precious memories of your childhood.","[0.6396766298816896, 0.30451770289497243, 0.41117077222861387]",,,

"I have been to amusement parks. Arcades and I have played and coached sports. I am very familiar with the concept of a prize. Which is why it has always been fascinating to me that some people refer to themselves as ""THE PRIZE"". whenever I hear someone say that. I wonder if they know what it really means to be a PRIZE. It is my belief that they like the idea of being sought after. But they fail to see that being a prize must be won. But the prize is never the winner.","[0.3512038398475237, 0.29709813135352026, 0.13038491133960986]",,,
"Let's look at my first example of an amusement park. Amusement parks feature games that require as much luck as it does skill. The park creates the games with two central ideas in mind. The first is to make it seem easy. They create games that require the player to perform tasks that are familiar to them. The game, and game master, must make the player feel as if they possess the skills necessary to win. That they have a chance. The second and most important feature that the game must have. It has to provide an incentive that keeps the player engaged. And wanting to play again and again. That is where the prize come into play. The game is the challenge. But the prize is what attracts the player. It is the sole reason he/she is willing to make the sacrifice of their resources, (money) in order to play the game.      Amusement parks need to make a profit from their games. So, they need the player to play multiple time. So, they adapt a twofold strategy. First, they rig the game. They make the game look simple and easy. But they make slight alterations that are hardly noticeable. That make the game far more difficult than they appear. The second part of the strategy is more diabolical than the first. The display a huge, beautiful prize.  A prize far more valuable than the price of a chance to play the game. But the trick most player overlook. Is that there are prizes below the big beautiful one that attracted them to the game. Prizes that have far less value that the top prize.","[0.1928530343655968, 0.015728480577204697, 0.2035304233368753]",,,

"The purpose of the Amusement park having a tiered prize system, is simple. The big prize attracts the players. While the lesser prizes let the players, who will most often fail to win the game, not leave empty handed. Despite not achieving the goal they had intended. The lesser prize is intended to make the player still FEEL like a winner. But in actuality. They are merely given a reminder of their failure. Imagine traveling with a group to an amusement park. And when it is time to leave. Walking out next one of your group mates, who is struggling to carry their large, beautiful prize. While you are carrying small, bug eyed spikey haired troll on a key chain. That can fit in your pocket. Would you still feel like a winner.","[0.2791372595663683, 0.023147675752378902, 0.25248578930848514]",,,
"The example of the Amusement park is easy to understand. But it does not quite cover the concept of people being a prize. People as prizes are more like the trophies you get for playing sports. There is some luck involved. But skill and preparation are far more important. But the prizes are still tiered. They still exist on levels. And the player still needs to achieve a certain amount of success, just to get the opportunity to compete for them. So, in order to win the top prize, you must become and compete against the top players. And it this aspect of the competition that I think those who consider themselves a prize lose sight of what it means to be a prize. In order to be a great player and win great prizes. The player must commit to training, practicing, and studying the game. To studying and preparing for their competition. That means that winners are those who spend the most time preparing for the game, and the least amount of time, studying about the PRIZE.","[0.34817458491966174, -0.005790997123579591, 0.3692999435892263]",,,
"Think of the last time you saw someone, or even you left an amusement park with the big prize. Now ask yourself. Where else have you seen that prize? The big amusement park prize is special because it seen by all of the other players who tried and failed. It gives the winner a level of status in that moment. But when the winner leaves the amusement park. And takes the prize into a new environment. It immediately becomes a burden. It simply does not fit into most people's lifestyle. Despite playing the game hoping to win. Most amusement park goers are not prepared to take home a 4 foot tall stuffed animal. And even if they have a vehicle to carry it home. They often have no place to store it. Let alone display it. The big prize is often cast aside. Or given away, long before the winner even leaves the parking lot. So, the prize in that situation may not even get to go home with the winner. Due to the fact that the player won a prize they were not prepared for. The prize immediately loses it value to its winner. And ends up someone who may not have even played the game.","[-0.0539506843762622, 0.13985495484375635, -0.07548720057597044]",,,
"As a former player and coach of youth sports. I have been a part of many competitive matches in which there was a prize involved. Most of the time it was a trophy. There have been times when teams I have played for or coached, won that trophy. And it was exciting and an honor each time. We were very happy and proud in that moment. We would then take those trophies home. And display them proudly. Sometimes we would even make a special place for them. So that they could be seen and appreciated. But I noticed that as time moved on. So did the trophy. You see in sports we have seasons. And that trophy represents what we accomplished in that season. But there is always a new season coming. When one season ends, a new one begins. A different game with different players. With a new trophy waiting to be won at the end. And if the same player who won the last trophy plays the new game in the new season. And wins again. Then where does he place the new trophy. That player could opt to keep both and display both. But most often, the newest is most prized. So, the old one is moved aside. And the new one given its place. The old Trophy is still a prize. But it is now a prize in the back of a closet. Or on a shelf in the garage and not on the mantle in the living room. The only way a trophy gets to stay on display. Is if the player never plays, or never wins again.","[0.738053082895913, 0.35193795831498204, 0.4742266825585844]",,,
"If you like watching competitions of all types. You are familiar with all sorts of prizes. There are some prizes that specific to certain games. And can only be achieved by succeeding at the highest level of competition of that game. For example, the highest prize in football is the Lombardy trophy. You can't win it by playing hockey. That means that in order for a player to win the prize they seek. The must train, study the rules for, practice the game and win at the level that must be played. In order to achieve their goals and win the prize they seed to win. This brings me to my most important point. The job of the prize is to make itself desirable to be won. But it has no control or choice of who wins. The prize is the result of winning the game. But it does not participate. It has no say on when the game will be played. It does not make the rules for the game. And does not know when it will end. Very often those who consider themselves a prize, measure those who try to claim them. Instead of measuring themselves against those who are with the player they desire. If you consider yourself a prize. You must honestly evaluate those playing for you. Are they the best competitors in their game. Are they playing against competitors at a high level. How do they compare with those you have known to have won a Grand Prize in the past. And be honest with yourself.","[0.06521143080716588, 0.07336402302623928, 0.0498651249029239]",,,

But she was in medical school graduate, and he was in the military. He didn't believe she would consider him as a good match because he was only a low-ranking soldier. And couldn't compete financially with all the other doctors who were also trying to catch her attention. But he worked up the nerve to ask her on a date. And to his surprise, she accepted. While on their way to dinner. He noticed a small dog on the side of the road. It appeared to be injured. His heart broke for the animal. Without even thinking, he pulled over. He got out and went over to animal. It was hurt badly. He gently picked the animal up and placed it on his back seat. He then got back in the car and began talking to the dog as her hurried to a vet. Saying things like, ""Don't worry. It will be OK."" When they got the vet, they were informed that the dog's leg was broken. And there would be a charge if he wanted it treated. And since they didn't know who or even if the dog had an owner. They would have to put the dog down. If there was no one to pay for it. So, he began to emphatically apologize to his date.

And lots of will power. To be fit is HARD. It is also admirable to be wealthy. Or at least financially unincumbered. The most common trait of those people. Is that they don't spend thoughtlessly. Or impulsively. They consistently place a portion of their income into saving and long-term investments. And they are able to resist the temptation to spend it when they see it accumulating. And when the world is always trying to sell you something. And some of those things seem really cool. Saying no, is HARD.","[0.34873393888294285, 0.004264851161479081, 0.36130015734250953]",,,

He was handsome but he wasn’t someone I would ever have a chance with &amp; he wasn’t the type that I got crushes on.

I followed that story in the news every day. They mentioned that the funeral would be private &amp; I got really upset &amp; emotional about that.

Her voice is lower than I expected. I’m not saying it was deep but it’s not a high sweet sounding voice.

"A cyclical cycle that encompasses the psyche of every atom that has come to exist. Even the atomic theories that are being studied today are dedicating time to capture immortality. However, within science and studies are they forgetting the power of our innate abilities? I've grown to understand our existence as a fragile, and brisk moment of momentum. Our environment gives us purpose to distract us from the inevitable. We’ve conjured ideas of immortality in reward for our mortal capacity for empathy. The weighing of the heart and the feather has influenced people to think outside themselves. But when does the horde and mob minds turn violent in the attempt to save everyone from damnation. Are we damning ourselves for running in circles trying to save everyone. When will the group get tired and just preserve themselves? With so many thoughts and not a single mortal individual to coherently organize thoughts it gives the impression that mass confusion and betrayal is bound to appear. Especially when the de-facto leaders are lying to their peers and holding secrets disabling their subordinates to perform critical thinking. Without critical thinking and peer reviewal we are bound to play the game of telephone not knowing if truth’s beneficial to reassert itself anymore. Dedicating my adulthood to not being lied to has been a hard obstacle because my peers are sustained and comfortable with lies if it doesn’t affect gas or food.","[-0.04189190545036264, 0.2608540693826125, -0.1335602220915708]",,,
"Whenever those two products increase civil unrest succeeds even further. Within the last 5 years the theater stage for our “World Leaders” has given us a new anxiety that hasn’t been felt by the tech-world. Disloyalty across the board in every department makes believing in anything a fleeting belief. Now a quarter-life veteran that has nothing better to do than condemn our world. My biggest question for myself is “What do I want to do about all of it?” The belief that the sword would free us all only encourages Hammurabi’s code. Now a swordless warrior, what further meaning does that “warrior” have. The redefining of a warrior was the beginning of preserving one’s identity. An identity that has abandoned the user a long time ago. Being a ""warrior of truth"" is even more condemning with the burden of never wanting to be fooled by such easy and feasible lies. The options have become so limitless that choice even gets daunting. This journey has exposed me to the “gut” feeling and allowed me to make conscious logical connection about these groups without their influence of pressure, fear, and cohesion. Abandoning the group was a confusing gift as previously solitude from the world felt like a damnation of exile that no man should have to endure. The exile grows blind to the boundless opportunity of discernment. Discerning what values are true and what has been constructed for the “safety” of the group.","[-0.21722750884308112, 0.22267187049381434, -0.1537487043528152]",,,

"I enjoy reading. I enjoy writing. Though, I haven't done much of either since high school. Ive been reading a few of Colleen Hoover's books lately. Ive only recently realized the kinds of books I like; romance novels. Ive always known myself to be a hopeless romantic. Getting lost in the characters, and living vicariously through them is fun. It feels like Im experiencing the story myself, firsthand. I am the protagonist. Ive always wanted to live a tale like in storybooks. To be in the moment, and live my life like a made-up dream. Through rose colored glasses. Maybe that's what people mean by ""romanticizing"" your life. Initially, I interpreted that phrase as delusion. Exaggerate, and ""fake"" your reality in order to make it appear better than what it truly is. How would you even differentiate the two? Is it truly the best kiss, or the best chocolate chip cookie Ive ever had, or am I telling myself it is? Does it really matter anyway? Trying to intellectualize life really does ruin your perception. Im sure plenty of people just *live.* I mean truly live life for what it is, and they accept it. They're contempt. Satisfied. Happy. Is that what 'happiness' is? Accepting your reality for what it is and finding the joy in that? What happened to creating joy, looking for it, and finally capturing it? One could argue that accepting it for what it is is a form of being passive. Not fighting for what you want.","[0.5834207151391618, 0.3974272065996343, 0.33812210620264377]",,,
"It's possible that Im approaching this in the wrong way. The chatter in the back of my mind of every day is non-stop, the thief of joy, of appreciation. How is your brain conditioned to behave in such a way? Who programmed this, and how do I reboot? Ive always felt like I could do anything. I could be anyone I wanted to be. Conceptually, I feel invincible. Nothing was unachievable.. but somewhere along the way, I didn't want to be anything. I stopped caring to be anything, anyone. I don't want to do anything. I just merely want to exist, and observe. Absorb. Exhausting. The running thoughts are exhausting. If only I could master disassociation from myself. Maybe I could stop caring, and needing. Stop searching. Searching. Always searching. Wtf am I searching for? The only thing I can come up with is peace. The search for freedom. Escapism. Understanding. How fucking boring is that? Are we all just searching?","[-0.4645552550516491, 0.21111032392052953, -0.24210581838522638]",,,
"Are our relationships and life a direct reflection of ourselves? I don't know how I could have cultivated, or manifested such things. What is the underlying attraction for madness? Stop asking so many questions. You're intellectualizing. Perhaps it's much more simple. It's the cards you are dealt. But the idea of being able to step out of your skin, to be a free spirit. To roam, to be unperceived. A complex. The natural need for interaction, being the very thing you avoid. To be and not to be. Could that be the caveat of it all? Maybe it's the pun, it's the joke to life. It's what keeps us moving. Evolving. It could be the very purpose of it all. A comedy show, or even a prank. Don't take It so seriously, or you'll spiral chasing understanding. Just exist, and enjoy the show until the curtains close.","[0.24106223031494597, 0.26958830320483007, 0.06529355730774006]",,,
