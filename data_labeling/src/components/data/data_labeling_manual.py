#takes input reddit posts vad
# #-	Got the data in and cleaned from reddit
# -	Now focusing on labeling
# -	7,000 instances around :10 hours 
# -	Auto labeled data using my previous naïve method
# -	Now need to build manual data labelling
# o	a simple labeling UI (web app, Jupyter notebook, or even a snpreadsheet) that displays the text and the model's VAD prediction
# 	either Accept the model's label,
# 	Adjust the values (e.g., sliders for V, A, D),
# 	Delete the entry
# I want to be able to keep track of the last entry i labeled so that  i can pick up where i left off next session
