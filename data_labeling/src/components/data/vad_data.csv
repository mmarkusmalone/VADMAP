"It's been so incredibly hot these past few days. It's just completely knocked me out. And it's not like this is the hottest it's ever been, and temperatures like this are not necessarily rare around here, but we came from really cold and rainy weather earlier this week.

One of the reviewers is this professor from the US, and he's like the biggest name in my field, I am not exaggerating when I say he pretty much created the field I work in. And you'll never believe what he wrote in his review (at least, I still don't believe it). He wrote When I say this [main section of the paper] is well-written, I mean it. I'm gonna use it as an example for my students from now on!",0.33,0.07,0.23
"Let me tell you, I wept when I read that. Fucking cried tears of joy. All these years it's been a constant fight against my insecurities, anxieties, the voices in my head that I'll never do anything that's good. Saying that everything I'll ever write is pure shit, every new sentence the absolute worst one that's ever been written. The days I've spent lying in bed paralyzed with fear, because everything I ever do is wrong. The people in my environment telling me that I never do well enough. And of course it was bigger than just this one paper, but the writing was such a big part of it.",-0.42,0.39,-0.27

However, in those situations, I had deep conversations with all of those people before acting on my feelings for them. I had a fairly good idea of their wants, needs, and goals in life and in relationships. We’d gotten to know each other on a deep level despite the short period of time. With this guy, however, we got to know each other at a moderately deep level before dating but never had any of those truly deep conversations.

I spent so much of my early 20s pretending I was older, thinking I would marry the first man I dated and doing all the inner work to be ready to be a wife. Plan A failed, as with all things in life, and I found myself single and re-learning how to enjoy my life last summer. One of the positive outcomes of that whole ordeal was finding a friend group of mixed ages/ backgrounds, where not everyone was my immediate type of person, but I did end up meeting some great people, including this guy.",-0.3,0.16,-0.52

I'm a preppy Ivy League graduate raised in an uptight conservative household so I didn't expect to mesh so well with him, but I can't deny he makes me feel butterflies. We bonded over shared politics last summer, and I vowed to myself I'd keep things strictly platonically because I didn't think he could be the type of partner I wanted based off of how he presents himself in public (plus, that pesky age gap!).",0.14,0.04,0.02
"However, I've gotten to know him more over the last few months and I can tell he embodies a lot of the traits I want in a partner. We've been talking and we kissed last week but I still don't know where to go from here. I can't stop thinking about the kiss and I want to see him again soon but my head's all convoluted. I can't tell many people about it because some of my friends would disapprove, the only two people I've told I feel I've exhausted and he's just been running through my mind 24/7?? I don't think he wastes as much free time thinking about me. I don't think I'm a good partner for a relationship at this stage in my life (and frankly, I was even worse off when I was with my ex) because I'm defending my PhD soon and I am too much with my eating disorder issues right now, but I like him so much?? I'm so scared to see how this all ends, like I know I'll be bummed big time when he moves on and finds someone more age-appropriate or more his type, but I'm having so much fun this summer! He takes me out to music shows I wouldn't normally go to (not out of lack of interest, I just never know what is going on) and he's made me feel young again for once. I know at 27 I shouldn't feel like my life is over, but I've spent so many years cosplaying a middle aged woman that it feels good to go stupid every once in a while (within reasonable bounds) and enjoy being wrapped in the biceps of a younger dude who's not as jaded lol.",-0.14,0.48,-0.57

"I bought them both at the marketplace. Very cheap vodka, and the classic Takis, my favorite. Bought wired ear phones, jamming out later than I should be in a foreign country, but enjoying the time by myself and generally being very introspective and depressing myself with nihilism and general loneliness. I'm home then, and bring them both out. The vodka tasted like hospitals, the Takis 7/11. I wanted to be like the movies, drunk texting your ex at 1 am. So I got drunk for the first time, and ate a few Takis. The burns paired well together. Embarrassed myself thoroughly texting Sasha, just like I wanted to I guess. Dante Rinya Alisa and her went to Santa Barbara together. All my friends, without me, went to the college that I've wanted to go to for a long time, the one I'm the only one smart enough to get into, the one I know a ton about and am going to in the fall. Like my dad says in his annoying ass emphasis, a slap in the face. I told her I was jealous. Now when I'm reflecting I think it was more a deep, listless, hopeless, sadness. One where I might imagine a dark place, the ground hard and unforgiving, looking up at a God. I crave my neck to the point it hurts. I can't behold the entire being, it's head and edges so large they are enshrowded due to the sheer distance.

"Today, I woke up at about 3am. I started working on the gasket between the toilet seat and the tank. This time, I had prepared by watching a couple of tutorials on YouTube. I followed the recommendations of both people, and also, listened to the directions of my dad. He flipped the gasket upside down, which is wrong in the instructions, but after looking at the improper opening of our toilet, I saw the wisdom in why he would do it that way. I set everything up, but I needed some hardware, so I put that on my to do list. One of the things, I wanted to do as well, is to take a return to the UPS store. It was all on the same route, so I waited until about 7am because most everything opens at that hour. I started my ascent because it would take me about 30 minutes, jogging across town to the furthest checkpoint. If I did everything fast, I’d be home before the sun heated everything outside, too much. Three things I took care of: UPS return (I got something healthy to drink at the grocery store in the same vicinity), hardware at the local hardware store, and pick up food at Taco Bell on the way home.",0.16,0.01,0.55

"Meanwhile, my dad had been working on getting his cars up to par with smog and registration. He also mentioned that one of my sisters’ car had broken down in Fresno, about two and half hours away. He was waiting on a mechanic to show up so he could go there and have it fixed. I showed him the fixed toilet tank and his stomach rumbled. We were both hungry. Luckily, he had fish frying on the stove and I had my bag of Taco Bell. We sat down to eat. Afterwards we tinkers with some pocket knives. He was anxious about going to Fresno to get my sister’s car fixed. He called the mechanic and asked him when a good time was to check the car out. The mechanic replied that at about 4pm would be good. My dad went to submit approved smog papers to his insurance agency and they gave his renews registration with tags. He told me he was going to Fresno. For some reason, I tagged along with him. I gathered my things as best I could. I did forget my sunglasses (on such a bright day!). Anyway, we left. It was a long, decent, but hot ride there. For some reason, Fresno is hotter than the city where we live, like, desert hot. I’m amazed how many green trees, palms, shrubs, and green lawns there are. Many streets are paved with them. We got to my sisters neighborhood and went inside. Her home about was as hot as the outside air. It was so hot, I just remember laying down on a bench and passing out.",0.15,0.05,0.13
"I woke up, to my sister coming home from work, about an hour later. As I came to, she unloaded and organized her things. All of a sudden, I was really hungry. She said she was as well. She showed me a menu to a restaurant and asked me what I wanted, so she can place a phone order. She then went to check on my dad, in the garage. I don’t know what happened, but all of a sudden, she called me. We got in her car and started driving through the freeway. While chatting with her, she suggested a sandwich place we went to as we were younger. I agreed and she pulled off the freeway. We parked and walked inside. After figuring out what we want, we ordered, filled our fountain drinks, and took a seat. They had air conditioning. One of the people brought us a bag full of sandwiches. We “broke bread” and unwrapped our sandwiches. We ate and talked about recent riot that broke out in Los Angeles. Conversation became heated after, that.

Finally, at 7:45pm, the mechanic called and asked if we were still there. My dad was getting ready to leave. They agreed that they would reach an agreement and meet up another day. My dad directed us to go. I gathered my stuff, said goodbye and walked out to the truck. Once everyone was ready, we left; back to the freeway. We are taking the 99 back to Tracy.",0.48,0.43,0.47

We were friends for 5 years, and the whole time I was absorbing what she said and taking it as the truth. When we were in middle school once, she put me in a group chat on kik (nothing good happened on kik) and sent a number of long paragraphs about how all of them hated me, and I was so mean and negative and not fun to be around. But despite everyone else telling me that they didn’t agree at all and she just did that herself, I believed HER.

"Cringe, I know, but I did theatre in high school. And college. And there’s a universe out there where I’m still doing it now. All my life, I wanted to do theatre. Growing up, I was always encouraged to perform. I’d tried dance classes and guitar lessons and cheer and voice lessons, and the one that really stuck was voice. At nine, I started attending voice lessons every Thursday. Every year after that until I was 15, I did summer music camps. I’d always wanted to be a performer - a singer and an actor. Then I met Ms. G. I wouldn’t know this until I was in too deep, but Ms. G had a reputation for not being nice to the girls. She had a… preference for the boys, you could say. She never did anything untoward, but she certainly liked the boys a lot better. But when I saw Seussical: The Musical, I knew I wanted to work with her. I wanted to do musical theatre. So I ask her what I should try to do in the next show, and she tells me Assistant Stage Manager. Cool! I just want to be involved! So I do it, and I like it okay. But I start dating one of the Theatre Boys. The musical comes and I chicken out of auditioning - everyone else seems so good. Plus, that friend from earlier was auditioning. I couldn’t take away her shot. I ASM again, it’s fine. She convinces me to partner up in leadership with my boyfriend at the time, and despite my hesitancy, I do it.",-0.12,0.16,-0.44

When I wanted to leave the position the following year, her and that friend seemed to come together to convince me not to. I would be betraying the team AND her if I did, and how could I do that? The following year, I audition for the musical. I receive a different crew role that I did not ask for. I’m not on the cast list, and it breaks my heart but I get it. Sobbing, I email her asking what I can do better next time. She replies, she left me off the cast list by mistake. Whatever. I was ensemble, which was fun. When she’s choosing our senior year musical, she tells me I HAVE to audition, there’s the perfect role for me. It’s a boy role, but for vocal reasons, casting a girl was better, as he’s very young. When the time comes around, i’m hesitant to audition again - I didn’t get chosen last time and I didn’t get chosen for competition, so I must not actually be good. I tell her I want to help her direct it. She tells me no, that if I apply for director and don’t audition, she will not include me at all. I audition, I fight for that role tooth and nail.

Saudade[a] (English: /saʊˈdɑːdə/;[2] plural saudades) is a word in Portuguese and Galician denoting an emotional state of melancholic or profoundly nostalgic longing for a beloved yet absent someone or something. It derives from the Latin word for solitude.[3] It is often associated with a repressed understanding that one might never encounter the object of longing ever again. It is a recollection of feelings, experiences, places, or events, often elusive, that cause a sense of separation from the exciting, pleasant, or joyous sensations they once caused. 3.

When I was 5, I moved to a new city, and he was my first friend. He was my best friend for a long time; we'd spend afternoons playing, and he'd give me little gifts like rocks for my fish tank or treats for my cat. I especially remember one day when we went to his beach house; it was the first time I saw hail. We were around 8 years old, and we were in the pool when it started raining. Everyone else got out, but we hid under a bridge that went over one side of the pool. Maybe I had a crush on him, and I like thinking about that. Later that day, when we were playing with his siblings, he didn't want to heat up noodles to impress me. His brother teased him, saying something like, You're eating cold noodles to impress your girlfriend? We both felt awkward, and I laughed at him.",-0.14,0.38,-0.78

I changed classes and kept in touch with some friends for a while, but eventually, I lost touch with all of them, except not really, because my best friend wasn't part of that group anymore. Maybe he felt betrayed; I don't know, and I didn't care back then. It's been 6 years since we last spoke. I changed schools. I've greeted some of those friends when I ran into them, but not him. I still haven't mustered the courage. And I still love him very much. I feel so much saudade for him, but no matter how hard I try, I still can't bring myself to talk to him. The most I've done is follow him on Instagram and like a birthday story he reposted. Still, all my phone widgets are about us. Whenever I see something related to friendship, I think of him. Whenever I see something related to childhood, I think of him. I dreamed about him last year; he hugged me, and I think about that feeling a lot.

People who find new connections in the middle of their last ones while I can’t even begin to make the first. I’ve been cheated on and lied to, used, one date only situations. It just makes me feel horrible. Like I’m not worth the time to get to know deeper and more personally. Then I overthink every little tiny thing I do, recounting and reflecting to the point where it’s probably not healthy anymore. I’m deeply, excruciatingly aware of my flaws and work so hard on myself every day. I try to be a better version of myself than the day before, but it just goes unnoticed.

Even when I’m busy I make time for people, I listen fully and try my best to show that. I remember small details of people, I bring up things they tell me in passing. I do my best. I try so hard. Why can’t someone just try for me too? Why can’t I get the return of my efforts? I get home from work and do…nothing. Sometimes I’ll go out but there isn’t much around (or at least open late). I want to be thought of, remembered. I want love and kindness the way I give it to other people. And then I feel so selfish for 1. Thinking that I put effort in, and 2. For not recognizing what I have. But I genuinely do for both and I think that’s why it’s so grating. I feel selfish and stupid for comparing myself too but it’s just hard not to.

I was just sitting there kind of awkwardly, like so... Idk, do you have any questions? Then I noticed than one of them (the not weird one) had tears in his eyes. He was just weeping, very silently. He was crying for me. So we cried together, and hugged it out. It was actually quite wholesome.",0.1,-0.04,-0.09

Anything I say always gets ignored, activities I suggest always get dismissed, when I put a song in the queue it always gets skipped, stuff like that. I'm never treated like a fucking human bei who's worth acknowledging. And normally this one friend is there to balance it out, but this time she was almost physically stuck to the groom. Which is fair, and I don't blame them, but I was then left with these people that treat me like shit.

I explained that she would need to get a transfer ticket, so she could board the right bus at the transit station, without getting charged twice. She crossed the street in the wrong direction, so I had to redirect her back towards where I told her the right bus would pick her up. There were two bus stops across from each other, but one went to the shopping center and the other towards downtown. Judging by the direction of the traffic where the stop was placed, I told her, her best bet was the one going away from town. We were already at the edge of town, so I figured, it had to make a loop and go back to the transit station. We were literally crossing the street when the bus started showing up.
