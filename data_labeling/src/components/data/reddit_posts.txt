[real] (06/13/2025) hot summer evening
It's been so incredibly hot these past few days. It's just completely knocked me out. And it's not like this is the hottest it's ever been, and temperatures like this are not necessarily rare around here, but we came from really cold and rainy weather earlier this week. So now my body is not used to it and doesn't understand what to do about it and just kinda shuts down.

I got the reviews on my paper back (PatatjeKroketje et al., in review). One of the reviewers is this professor from the US, and he's like the biggest name in my field, I am not exaggerating when I say he pretty much created the field I work in. And you'll never believe what he wrote in his review (at least, I still don't believe it). He wrote "When I say this [main section of the paper] is well-written, I mean it. I'm gonna use it as an example for my students from now on!"

Let me tell you, I wept when I read that. Fucking cried tears of joy. All these years it's been a constant fight against my insecurities, anxieties, the voices in my head that I'll never do anything that's good. Saying that everything I'll ever write is pure shit, every new sentence the absolute worst one that's ever been written. The days I've spent lying in bed paralyzed with fear, because everything I ever do is wrong. The people in my environment telling me that I never do well enough. And of course it was bigger than just this one paper, but the writing was such a big part of it.

Recently I've begun to realize that those voices in my head are not an objective truth, not always rational. But it feels so validating to hear it from someone else. Especially if that is someone I've been looking up to for years now.

Currently, dusk is *finally* setting in, and it's started to cool down by one or two degrees. I'm almost starting to feel like a functioning human being again. The swifts have all returned to their nests. People are shutting their blinds and turning off the lights.

At the end of the day, I can't help but miss you. Which is strange, because what is there to miss, right? We were never anything, were we? So then... Why do I feel like I want it back?

Asking “Is this okay?” after doing that thing is not truly asking for permission. 

Sure, things happen in the heat of the moment. You try something that feels right in the moment. Often times, it works out just fine. Often times, it doesn’t — and in those cases, it’s a simple “okay, let’s try something else” or “okay, let’s cool down the intensity.” There’s a lot of situations where a little bit of that trial-and-error risk is natural. 

*Note: If any young people are reading this: Ask BEFORE, not AFTER. I understand that things happen in the heat of the moment, but it’s never worth the risk of making someone feel uncomfortable. As I said, there’s a lot of situations where a little risk/trial-and-error is tolerated, but there shouldn’t have to be. And certainly not in a situation like mine, hanging out with a stranger at their place.*

***

You and I decided to meet up and get high together shortly after matching on one of those goddamn hookup apps. We both attend the same college and run in adjacent social circles. We’re both pansexual and non-binary. We have mutual friends and followers on Snapchat and Instagram. We hadn’t heard of each other before, but we weren’t total strangers. 

We had agreed that we weren’t meeting up to do anything sexual tonight. I wasn’t in the mood and I explained that. You agreed that it would be better not to do anything. The plan was to chill and get high. 

Unexpectedly, you offered me something stronger too. It was my first time trying this type of pill, but it wasn’t yours. 

You encouraged me to sit next to you on the bed because it was more comfortable.

You asked “Wanna cuddle?”

I said “Sure, why not?” 

I was wary, but you seemed safe enough. I assumed your intentions were innocent.

You leaned in closer to me, and you wrapped your hand around my waist.

You asked “Is this okay?” 

I said “Yeah, this is good for now.”

You moved your hand to my chest.

You asked “Is this okay?”

I stated my boundaries. “I’m fine with you touching me over my shirt, but not under.”

I still wasn’t really in the mood, but I figured some sensual touch wouldn’t hurt. 

You listened for a few minutes, and then you started playing with the hem of my shirt, touching the skin underneath the hem and once again asking “Is this okay?”

I replied “Okay, just don’t go further.”

I surmised that I was fine with this. After all, I said “not under.” This wasn’t technically “under.” I figured you were trying to be respectful while also being excited, so I didn’t mind the more intimate touch. 

He listened, putting his hand back over my shirt for a bit. He reassured me “I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.”

Then he started caressing the skin underneath the hem of my shirt again, and he slipped his hand underneath. He asked “Is this okay?”

On high alert, I responded “It’s fine, just no more than this.”

It was an instinctual fawn response. I didn’t have the chance to say “no.” He had already touched me before asking for permission.

But I had already stated my boundaries before, hadn’t I? I said “not under” — which isn’t the word “no,” but has the same meaning as “no.”

That should’ve been enough.

*It should have been enough.*

My body was tense as he played with my nipples for a few minutes, rubbing at them in a rough manner and pinching them erratically.

It was clear what he wanted. He didn’t hide it either. 

Every time he tried something new with my nipples, he said “I’m horny, I don’t want to make you uncomfortable though.” 

Several times, I responded with a loosely affirmative answer like “That’s fine, just no further” or “I’m good with this right now” or “I’m okay, but nothing more than this.” 

I was trying to keep him from escalating as he had previously. I thought I could satisfy him without doing anything even more uncomfortable. 

Eventually, he noticed. He stepped back and expressed genuine remorse to her, saying that he thinks he misread the situation. She assured him that she would be open to something in the future, but not tonight — she just wasn’t in the mood, and it wasn’t his fault. 

They sat up together for a little bit. He said he was coming down from his high and asked if they could go back to just cuddling. She agreed, but said she would get a ride home soon because she was tired.

She told him her Uber was three minutes away and sat up. He said he typically has bad comedowns and asked her to stay for another thirty minutes, so she obliged, taking the $5 cancellation fee. He said that she didn’t have to cancel her ride, but his tone of voice revealed he was desperate for her to stay. He even offered to pay for the Uber back. She felt obligated.

He asked to cuddle as he came down from his high, which she said “okay” to. She stayed sat upright while he lied down and wrapped his arms around her. 

He caressed the bare skin on her waist and stroked her back underneath her shirt. He rubbed and poked and pinched her nipples. 

He moved his hands to her thighs, inching closer to what was in between. 

He haphazardly asked “This fine?” to which she responded with a simple “Mhm.” 

She just wanted it to stop, but she didn’t believe he would stop. By this point, she knew his behavior contradicted his polite words.

She counted down the seconds to the end of the song playing in the background, hoping she could tell him she was tired and needed to go home. 

He grinded his hand against the mound in between her legs. Realizing that he wasn’t looking at what she was doing on her phone, she booked an Uber. Priority ride, of course. 

She asked her sister to text her with an emergency 2 minutes before the Uber arrived. She pretended to be shocked, showing him the texts and worriedly rushing out. She said she needed to go and apologized, quickly asking if he’d be okay. 

She could tell he actually needed another person and that he was mentally nervous, but she felt the primal urge to leave. She knew why, but her brain wouldn’t let her process the gravity of the situation in the moment. She felt horrible as she grabbed her things and rushed out the door, texting him afterward to ask how he was handling the comedown. 

When she got home, she took off her clothes and put them in the laundry hamper. She usually wore her t-shirts and sweatpants a few times before washing them, but they seemed especially *dirty* tonight. She immediately put the two garments in the washing machine and made a beeline for the shower. She let boiling hot water run down her chest and back until she felt clean again.

She distracted herself for a few hours, reflecting on her past relationships and asking strangers whether she was wrong to leave him alone while he was high before finally lying down and writing about her night. 

Her final thought was that she hated how much she felt like a woman in this moment despite the fact that she wasn’t a woman at all.

*Note: There’s a double meaning to this last sentence. For starters, she’s a young adult and still feels like a young girl sometimes. Also, though, she’s nonbinary and feels disconnected from her own gender identity. The experience seems to have fucked with her sense of self strongly, at least for the time being.*

She’s tired. 

I’m tired.

[Real] (06/13/2025) - 001
So, it’s Friday morning and I’m back home from a night out that’s left me with mixed emotions. I don’t really want to think about it. 

I decided to open this account to possibly write about it, but I’m not in the mood to do that. I noticed a few people on my last post were interested in what happened with my ex, so I’m going to take some time to reflect on that instead. I’m kinda going to write out this entry Q&amp;A style. 

***

***Why didn’t it work out?*** 

There are a variety of factors, but there’s one incident that paved the way for the breakup.

Essentially, he made a joke on one of his social media accounts (not fully public, but still visible to his entire social circle) about “everyone he dates having an eating disorder.” 

His wording was in the present tense. He also frequently asks me what I eat, and I often respond saying I forgot to eat or that I haven’t eaten. My responses are an understandable cause for concern, but not solely indicative of an eating disorder. The last time I responded before seeing his social media post, he seemed kind of annoyed by my eating habits. Because of these factors, I assumed it was a passive-aggressive vaguepost about me since I’m the only person he was dating at that time.

I responded in like manner, with a simple :/ emoticon. He didn’t immediately deny that the post was about me, instead grilling into my eating habits. I didn’t like that, and I called him out on how fucked-up his response was, which he later apologized for. Apparently, it was a joke directed at his friends whom he’d dated in the past (and not me), but he admitted the optics were horrible. 

After that conversation and a genuine apology from him later, I told him we both need to reevaluate the relationship and listed some of my needs. I was hoping to highlight the differences in our needs that I’d picked up on over the past few weeks as a way of easing into a breakup. I opened the conversation by stating my needs. He responded with his and he caught my drift, suggesting that we’d be better off as friends.

The reason I didn’t write all this out in my initial diary post was because I’d already relayed all the details to my friends to get their opinions, and I was too tired to write it all again. I was just over it at that point. 

***What was wrong with my dream guy?***

I think it’s clear from my above contemplations that he’s got a lot of work to do in terms of understanding what is and isn’t appropriate in relationships — and not just romantic ones. I’d be equally livid, if not more so, if a friend did to me what he did. That incident showed that he still has a lot of work to do before he can call himself a mature adult. 

Also, the pacing was just… off. I’ve jumped into relationships with people before — including people I’d only met recently. However, in those situations, I had deep conversations with all of those people before acting on my feelings for them. I had a fairly good idea of their wants, needs, and goals in life and in relationships. We’d gotten to know each other on a deep level despite the short period of time. With this guy, however, we got to know each other at a moderately deep level before dating but never had any of those truly deep conversations. As such, the instant “I love you” and intensity of his feelings was off-putting.

***What makes me relieved? Why does being single make me so happy?***

I think I’m relieved because I know now that there isn’t something innately wrong with me for not instantly feeling the chemistry. I think my last paragraph highlights this well. I’m now more clearly able to identify why this felt different from my past relationships (which I elaborated on in my previous paragraph). 

Then, of course, there’s also the feeling of relief that comes from the aftermath of the major incident — I feel like I dodged a massive motherfucking bullet.

My echo was said to have looked normal. But even I know that it’s not 100% confirmed until I see the cardiologist and get the results. Something fun from today was I even got the cardiac sonographer to show me what my heart looked like while it was beating at different angles. The human heart is so interesting. 

I am feeling so awful after eating two slices of a deep dish pizza from Jet’s Pizza. It tasted good but wasn’t good enough to undo my amazing diet streak. That’s not to say I don’t indulge in a few Lindor chocolates or an ice cream bar here and there, but I don’t know. I’m feeling especially gross after this pizza.

I have a date on Monday. She’s 40 and has a daughter. I’m excited to learn more about both of them. I made resys at a beautiful bar near work. They have the most delicious nonalcoholic wine.

[Real] (6/12/25) finding calm
Work is burning around me and I'm so burned out I couldnt give a fuck.

Everything that could go wrong is going on, and theres nothing I can do to stop it, but thankfully nothing I did to cause it either.

So, I'm laying on the hammock, trying to relax. I finished my first full spin. A scratchy green yarn. Its not perfect, but I like it. Im proud of it so far. It needs a wash and dry. I think it may become part of an emotional support chicken, who knows.

I just need to make it through tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday. Then everybody can fuck off for 6 days. I need time off.

[Real] (6/12/25) Dear Diary
So I wanted to write about my day but wasn’t in the mood to write it on my diary, so I’m typing it instead.

After office today, we had a mindfulness session. Honestly, I was really annoyed at first because it was scheduled after work hours. If it had been during office time, I would’ve been fine with it. But staying two extra hours was tiring. I even ranted about it on the vent subreddit. 

Surprisingly though, the session turned out okay. There was a motivational talk, some yoga, and a short meditation. The yoga session was intense. I was sweating, all tired, but it felt good. It also made me realize I seriously lack flexibility. That was the coach’s point too, to help us understand our physical condition.

It made me reflect on myself too. I tend to react emotionally and judge things too quickly. Like today, I was so upset before the session started, but in the end, I kind of enjoyed it. If it had been shorter, maybe just one or one and a half hours, it would’ve been even better.

I didn’t agree with everything the coach said, but I guess not everything needs to match your views. The important thing is I got to move my body and try something new. Since I’m already skinny, I do have a chance to build and shape my body better if I stay consistent.

Let’s see how I feel tomorrow though, I can already sense the soreness. But it’s just three days, so I’ll manage.

Work has been okay. It’s been almost two months since I joined this office. I’m not fully satisfied, but I know I’m still at the beginning of my career. This place is good for learning. My mood keeps switching. Sometimes I want to quit and look for something better. Other times I feel like this is where I need to be for now. I think about my dad and how hard he worked. How he used to work till late evening and come home to deal with ungreatful kid like me. That helps me push through.

Right now I’m listening to Nirvana’s MTV Unplugged sessions while typing this. Summer is here and I don’t really enjoy it. The fan is on but not facing me properly. I’m too tired to get up and fix it.

That’s it for now. I’ll scroll a bit and then sleep. It was an alright day.

[real] (06/12/2025) why is having a crush so humbling?
On the one hand, I'm glad I'm finally over my ex, over a whole year after the breakup. On the other hand, I wish I understood my feelings better and was able to keep them close to my heart without having to broadcast them to the entire internet. 

I'm 27 years old and I feel like I've been regressing lately. I spent so much of my early 20s pretending I was older, thinking I would marry the first man I dated and doing all the inner work to be ready to be a wife. Plan A failed, as with all things in life, and I found myself single and re-learning how to enjoy my life last summer. One of the positive outcomes of that whole ordeal was finding a friend group of mixed ages/ backgrounds, where not everyone was my immediate type of person, but I did end up meeting some great people, including this guy. 

The guy in question is not exactly who most people would picture by my side. He's rough around the edges, three years younger than me, and deep into the heavy metal scene. I'm a preppy Ivy League graduate raised in an uptight conservative household so I didn't expect to mesh so well with him, but I can't deny he makes me feel butterflies. We bonded over shared politics last summer, and I vowed to myself I'd keep things strictly platonically because I didn't think he could be the type of partner I wanted based off of how he presents himself in public (plus, that pesky age gap!). 

However, I've gotten to know him more over the last few months and I can tell he embodies a lot of the traits I want in a partner. We've been talking and we kissed last week but I still don't know where to go from here. I can't stop thinking about the kiss and I want to see him again soon but my head's all convoluted. I can't tell many people about it because some of my friends would disapprove, the only two people I've told I feel I've exhausted and he's just been running through my mind 24/7?? I don't think he wastes as much free time thinking about me. I don't think I'm a good partner for a relationship at this stage in my life (and frankly, I was even worse off when I was with my ex) because I'm defending my PhD soon and I am too much with my eating disorder issues right now, but I like him so much?? I'm so scared to see how this all ends, like I know I'll be bummed big time when he moves on and finds someone more age-appropriate or more his type, but I'm having so much fun this summer! He takes me out to music shows I wouldn't normally go to (not out of lack of interest, I just never know what is going on) and he's made me feel young again for once. I know at 27 I shouldn't feel like my life is over, but I've spent so many years cosplaying a middle aged woman that it feels good to "go stupid" every once in a while (within reasonable bounds) and enjoy being wrapped in the biceps of a younger dude who's not as jaded lol. I'm looking forward to this weekend- might potentially see him?

[real] (6/12/25)
I slept 17 hours today and tomorrow is the day I go in to get an echo for my heart. I’ve been using Chat to understand more about the heart and it’s quite astounding how easy it is for me to understand things as long as I tell them to explain it to me like I’m five. 

I asked Chat why it’s easier for me to understand things this way and it says because five year olds don’t need fluff. They don’t need extra special words or jargon to get to the heart of the matter. They like visuals or metaphors that can allow them to visualize things and storytelling helps them too. I think that’s totally me. 

I hope they let me keep a copy of the echo results or at least take a photo of my echo, I think it would be so cool to look at.

[real] (6/12/2005) Only if I were a boy
Things could have been better if I were a boy. I could have earned money easily and helped my mom and dad. Like my brother, I could have started earning at the age of 18. I wouldn't have been a burden on my parents. My mother wouldn't have had to work in other people's homes, and we wouldn't have had to face so many problems— **only if I were a boy**

[real] (6/11/2025) Takis and Vodka
note: everything detailed is legal, and I'm doing okay mentally do not worry.

I bought them both at the marketplace. Very cheap vodka, and the classic Takis, my favorite. Bought wired ear phones, jamming out later than I should be in a foreign country, but enjoying the time by myself and generally being very introspective and depressing myself with nihilism and general loneliness. I'm home then, and bring them both out. The vodka tasted like hospitals, the Takis 7/11. I wanted to be like the movies, drunk texting your ex at 1 am. So I got drunk for the first time, and ate a few Takis. The burns paired well together. Embarrassed myself thoroughly texting Sasha, just like I wanted to I guess. Dante Rinya Alisa and her went to Santa Barbara together. All my friends, without me, went to the college that I've wanted to go to for a long time, the one I'm the only one smart enough to get into, the one I know a ton about and am going to in the fall. Like my dad says in his annoying ass emphasis, "a slap in the face." I told her I was jealous. Now when I'm reflecting I think it was more a deep, listless, hopeless, sadness. One where I might imagine a dark place, the ground hard and unforgiving, looking up at a God. I crave my neck to the point it hurts. I can't behold the entire being, it's head and edges so large they are enshrowded due to the sheer distance. It was the kind of sadness, I'd imagine, where I'm looking up at this being of infinite and immortal power. 

"Why," I ask. 

It's silent, although I can't see it clearly I feel its eyes and can make out their faint glow far above. 

Quieter, looking down to the ground, in a sort of harrowed whimper, I ask once more. 

"Why"

"Why why why why why"

If at all possible, I sense a sort of pity in the being above me, which for some reason I'd seemed to have forgotten. 

A reserved pity; a kind of condescending pity, with a touch of worry. 

I then look back up to the being, and in its eyes enshrowded I realize I felt no feeling from this being. I only imagined it. I look back down, oddly numb but still with that lingering pinch behind the eyes. 

Then I take another swig, and the Takis and Vodka make me sick to my stomach.

[real] (06/10/2025)
Today, I woke up at about 3am. I started working on the gasket between the toilet seat and the tank. This time, I had prepared by watching a couple of tutorials on YouTube. I followed the recommendations of both people, and also, listened to the directions of my dad. He flipped the gasket upside down, which is wrong in the instructions, but after looking at the improper opening of our toilet, I saw the wisdom in why he would do it that way. I set everything up, but I needed some hardware, so I put that on my to do list. One of the things, I wanted to do as well, is to take a return to the UPS store. It was all on the same route, so I waited until about 7am because most everything opens at that hour. I started my ascent because it would take me about 30 minutes, jogging across town to the furthest checkpoint. If I did everything fast, I’d be home before the sun heated everything outside, too much. Three things I took care of: UPS return (I got something healthy to drink at the grocery store in the same vicinity), hardware at the local hardware store, and pick up food at Taco Bell on the way home.
Once home, I was grateful. I put together the pieces, and crossed my fingers. This time, it appeared that there were no leaks after filling the tank. I smiled.
Meanwhile, my dad had been working on getting his cars up to par with smog and registration. He also mentioned that one of my sisters’ car had broken down in Fresno, about two and half hours away. He was waiting on a mechanic to show up so he could go there and have it fixed. I showed him the fixed toilet tank and his stomach rumbled. We were both hungry. Luckily, he had fish frying on the stove and I had my bag of Taco Bell. We sat down to eat. Afterwards we tinkers with some pocket knives. He was anxious about going to Fresno to get my sister’s car fixed. He called the mechanic and asked him when a good time was to check the car out. The mechanic replied that at about 4pm would be good. My dad went to submit approved smog papers to his insurance agency and they gave his renews registration with tags. He told me he was going to Fresno. For some reason, I tagged along with him. I gathered my things as best I could. I did forget my sunglasses (on such a bright day!). Anyway, we left. It was a long, decent, but hot ride there. For some reason, Fresno is hotter than the city where we live, like, desert hot. I’m amazed how many green trees, palms, shrubs, and green lawns there are. Many streets are paved with them. We got to my sisters neighborhood and went inside. Her home about was as hot as the outside air. It was so hot, I just remember laying down on a bench and passing out. 

I woke up, to my sister coming home from work, about an hour later. As I came to, she unloaded and organized her things. All of a sudden, I was really hungry. She said she was as well. She showed me a menu to a restaurant and asked me what I wanted, so she can place a phone order. She then went to check on my dad, in the garage. I don’t know what happened, but all of a sudden, she called me. We got in her car and started driving through the freeway. While chatting with her, she suggested a sandwich place we went to as we were younger. I agreed and she pulled off the freeway. We parked and walked inside. After figuring out what we want, we ordered, filled our fountain drinks, and took a seat. They had air conditioning. One of the people brought us a bag full of sandwiches. We “broke bread” and unwrapped our sandwiches. We ate and talked about recent riot that broke out in Los Angeles. Conversation became heated after, that. My sandwich had Turku slices, cranberry sauce, sriracha and fixings. It was actually very tasty. 

We walked back to the car. She drove us home. This time, took a more central route through downtown Clovis. I enjoyed the trip. Once home, she went to the backyard to water hydrangeas. At first sight of a bothersome mosquito, I went back inside. I was shopping on Amazon, for the remainder of the time. When they came back, my dad pointed out that the mechanic never showed. Finally, at 7:45pm, the mechanic called and asked if we were still there. My dad was getting ready to leave. They agreed that they would reach an agreement and meet up another day. My dad directed us to go. I gathered my stuff, said goodbye and walked out to the truck. Once everyone was ready, we left; back to the freeway. We are taking the 99 back to Tracy.

I’m about an hour in this return trip and I’m falling asleep.

 Goodnight!

[REAL] (6/11/2025) I wish things were different
my life is good in a lot of ways. I am objectively very privileged - I grew up middle class with parents who love me a lot and never pressured me into anything I didn’t want to do, plus i’m white and people tell me i’m pretty. I have a new job that will pay well and a wonderful partner and two lovely pets.

but still I feel lonely a lot of the time. and I worry I will never not worry about money again.
I have no friends really. a couple that I used to be really close with but not as much anymore. I never made friends in college or at any jobs. I have no real hobbies where I can go places and meet people. and since I got fired almost a year ago, i’ve been drowning financially.

I don’t know how to make friends, and I am having such a hard time getting back on my feet.

I wish things were easier. I wish I were better at things.

[Real] (06/10/25) Lonely
I'm lonely. 

Long ago an ex of mine told me nobody would love me and last year I discovered my parents don't love me unconditionally, only in the measure I obey and please them. So...

I'm lonely.

I have friends I can talk to. I have lots of obligations to fulfill and a full agenda. But...

I'm lonely.

I'm a christian who seeks to remain in The Word, and who finds refuge in it. I know I'm beloved by God. But, still...

I'm lonely.

Social media isn't helping too: there are just too many happy couples. So many people found love for them and I'm glad they did. But today...

I'm lonely. 

And I don't know when I will not be. I will not settle again, so there's a huge chance I will keep forever as I am. And...

I am lonely.

Song: [Touch Me Like A Gansta](https://open.spotify.com/track/6fYcQVXEuqmyS3HqSZ6rTd?si=8f103e76b77f46ec) by Jessie Murph

The oddness of talking to someone who listens, understands, and responds in a way that isn't anger even when they don't agree with you is the most *magical* relationship in the world. It's going to take a while to adjust to this type of friendship. I'm so used to over explaining and defending myself from the get go, that it's so nice to just know I don't have to do that anymore.

I've come a long way from the girl that would hermit and ghost every time something was bothering her, due a few select friends. They know who they are. Two of which have me on here and know who they are, all are some of my closest circle and god, I love you guys. Thanks for putting up with me. Especially right now as I work on up ending my entire life for the first *big* move I've ever made.

In so many ways. I'm *terrified*, but I am safe, I am wanted, I am loved, I am cherished, I am beautiful, I am smart. I am going places. I'm in a better spot mentally and emotionally than I've been in so fucking long and ya know what, the road to get here has not been easy. I don't think my small circle understands just how much I appreciate the safe place to just be me and exist and be embraced and loved for everything that I am. I hope that everyone can find that place.

The most rewarding thing is knowing that this isn't the end and that my hard work is going to pay off even more into even greater things. I wore a dress to my cardiologist appointment today. I got so many compliments and it felt a little odd, but it wasn't bad. I smiled a lot, I talked to strangers. I said thank you and accepted them all (this is rare for me, lol).

About my last post, I'm going to move forward with it. I've got this and I have friends that will help me have it. I'm not alone anymore and material things, they can be replaced. Better things are coming Reddit. They're just a hop, a skip, a jump away - 2-3 weeks til I move.

Soon, I'll need beta readers for my novel... it's coming along nicely and I am getting so nervous at exposing so much. Truth hurts and I feel bad for one person who is a huge part of the story, but the names and locations were changed. He won't step up anyways. 

"*So you can tell your friend, "shoot your shot" when you see 'em*  
*It's OK, he already in my DM*"

[real] (6/10/2025)
Today, I feel better about my body. It's been 2.5 months now of really focusing on diet, health and exercise and I had my lowest BP reading today. Yes, it's with amlodipine but I'm still proud of myself for the 122/78 reading this morning. 

I've been napping a lot more than usual and I'm wondering if this is just how I have always survived summer. 

I'm excited for the Pride events coming up. C has rented us a pool for a day and I want to make sure I look hot in a bathing suit which means I need to keep this up. I think I just need to remind myself that if this is what 2.5 months can do for me, then just imagine what the rest of my life can look like by averaging 10k steps a day, doing five sessions of strength training at the gym, yoga on occasion and weekly SoulCycle classes. 

I also find that even when I'm making the heartier foods, I am not as bloated when I make them at home instead of ordering from a restaurant. 

I also think that stopping with the prebiotics and probiotics was a good call. I should probably get back on the multivitamins though. 

I called the kids today to chat with them. I miss them a ton and I'm scared that they'll feel too cool to spend time with me when I visit in August. 

I've also been thinking a lot about my future as a mother and how I would be so excited to adopt as a single mom. I would give them books and instruments to play with, and we'd listen to audiobooks and podcasts and music. Eventually we would dive into cinema, but the screens will always be there, when the time to build a foundation for creativity and imagination is fleeting. We'd learn different languages and build things and plant a garden and I would teach them everything I know about the world. And we'd learn together the things I don't. 

I would make daily walks a priority and get them hooked on healthy whole foods . They would be my sous chef in the kitchen so that they know exactly what ingredients go into nourishing their bodies. And they would see the love that goes into making a meal for yourself and others. They would come to know that exercise is just as important as eating and sleeping. And they wouldn't eat their emotions because we would talk about them freely, without judgement. They'll never see me talk down to myself.

My children would feel loved unconditionally, and I would not pressure them to go to college if they didn't want to. It'd be nice if they did, but I would tell them to spend a year or two traveling before going to college. I would want my children to not have to worry about wanting for anything, but I also don't want them to put meaning and value into status symbols. I want them to enjoy life, be kind to others and to themselves. I want them to see the world with my childlike wonder. And I hope that they learn to love themselves enough to carry themselves through any pain that this world gives them.

I think in order to model this to them, I will need to be better about not punishing myself. And it’s true, I really should be less hard on myself.

[Real] (6/9/25) Is it disconnectedness or something else?
Do you ever feel like most social interactions are fake?
I thought of this question as I read several group chats I'm a part of on whatsapp. Was invited by acquaintances and in my attempt to break my loneliness and be more social I decided to join, but I keep forgetting that groups are not my thing.
All I keep reading is people saying hi and discussing the weather or what they had for breakfast, nothing wrong with that but honestly that is so monotonous to me.
They say loneliness is a global epidemic, and if your experiences are any similar to mine it's not surprising this is the case. People always seem too busy to have a meaningful conversation, when approached or reach out they don't respond. I'm terrible at small talk, (the conversation after a while dies), and am an introvert. Yes, I am part of the problem by being a bit boring but not having much surface-level material to talk about. A therapist once told me that most relationships are one-sided and if you want friendships you have to reach out even if the other side doesn't. I question the therapist's advise, but if that's the case that's sad and it gets so old and tiring after a while. Relationships are supposed to be reciprocal.
I want real, genuine, supportive connections. I want to slowly build genuine friendships. I'm that type of friend that when I ask someone how they're doing I actually want to know how they're really doing, not merely as a pleasantry. Tell me how your day's really been, let's talk about emotions, what you want from life, goals, dreams, aspirations. What makes you light up, how can we make life's challenges and burdens a bit easier to go through together, Reach out to me when you don't have anything to say but just want to spend time, when you have an important event and you want to talk about it, anything.
Maybe I'm the weird one? Perhaps it is not so bad to endlessly discuss what someone had for dinner, but I also know there has to be more than this. I think we are more interconnected due to technology and yet are more disconnected than before, and while in the short term that might not be a huge issue, and wonder and worry about the consequences in the long term.

[real] (06/09/25) Self improvement is a mental battle
Diabetes is rife in my family. My brothers have it, my mom's prediabetic, my dad has it, my grandma had it, all my uncles have it- even my Uncle John who has biked 20 miles a day for decades. 

It's not an "if" for me, it's a "when". 

I'm almost 28 and I haven't drank soda since 2014. I don't buy candy often cause it will cause rebound hypoglycemia. So I always have to eat some with protein. All my coffees are sugar free. 

I'm obsessed with my health.... well according to my ex boyfriend anyway. 

Both of my parents have rotted their teeth out, ignored health issues, smoke like chimneys. How could I not want to try to be better when I watched them suffer?

I can't eat gluten either. That means no bread, cake, breaded foods- most fast food places. 

And somehow I am still fat. 

I don't think fat is a bad thing. But I don't want to be fat. It's harder to find cute clothes. People treat you differently. Being bigger means biologically I'm at risk of diabetes which is something I'm trying to prevent. Most doctors blame everything on weight. "Oh you have cripplingly migraines 3-4 times a week? You should lose some weight." Everyone thinks you're a liar. "Oh you can't lose weight even when you workout, don't eat sugar, and don't eat much? Maybe you're not working out hard enough." I also look like my mother. And I don't want to look like her. 

Some people are beautiful while fat- I am not one of those. It's all disproportionately in my hips, ass and thighs. It's horrid trying to find a pair of jeans that fit well. 

I don't hate my body, I'm just frustrated with it. Not just with how it looks, but how it operates. 

My doctor doesn't want me to cut out dairy. She is concerned that I'm cutting out too much. But I'm willing to do anything to FEEL better. 

She thinks I have insulin resistance from my PCOS. Makes sense. 

Last year I was 245. I ate on average 800 cals a day. I hadn't had a period in 2 years and when I finally did, I bled for 3 months. 

So I started birth control to help with my PCOS symptoms. Then I cut out gluten and EVERYTHING got so much better. My bowel movements, my skin, the way I felt. I started to push for 1800 cals a day. I lost 20 pounds after that. 

I'm now 228. I've been hovering at 230 since last October. 

A few years ago they figured out that I'm vitamin B12, vitamin D, and iron deficient. My doctor only said " The fatigue trifecta -no wonder you're so tired". 

My iron deficiency was so bad that I was decently anemic. For two years I ate kale just about everyday in my eggs. I prioritized red meats and took iron supplements. My body wouldn't absorb it. 

It got bad enough that it started to affect my hemoglobin. So I had 2 iron infusions this year. Life changing really. I'm almost MAD at how good it feels. Like- everyone just casually feels this way? Has this much energy? I work at a hospital so I get steps in- 7.5-10k from work alone on average. I would force myself to workout only to have heart palpitations and anxiety post workout AND gain 5 pounds from it. 

Now I can go for a mile stroll after work without feeling anxious or ill. 

I've made progress even if it doesn't feel like it. Each step has been a battle. I had anxiety about taking birth control, about taking iron supplements and infusions, about eating 1800 cals a day, about how to eat without gluten...

My doctor recommended insitol. A supplement to help support hormone health and help with insulin sensitivity. I've had the container for a year, unopened. Another anxious battle. 

Will it help? Will I get headaches from it? Will it fuck up my guts? Will it do absolutely nothing and be a huge waste of time, energy, and hope? 

I hear good things. That it helps women ovulate- which is the issue with PCOS. That it helps insulin sensitivity which can aid in weight loss. 

I finally cracked it opened today and took it. 

A step closer, I won this battle today.

[real] (06/08/2025)
I woke up rested and healed. This was late in the afternoon. I had work at midnight on my mind, but in the meantime, the house needed service. After breakfast, I started preparing the house for a greater than usual, clean. I just took a break to walk to my local store for a bottle of water. 

So far, I’ve watered the house plants, I’ve cleaned the stove, Iv’e washed the dishes, I’ve picked up the bed, moved the furniture aside,  and prepared the bathroom for cleaning. 
 
I still have yet to clean the bathroom, wipe the dining room table, sweep/ mop the floors, shower, and perhaps clean the tub in no particular order. I hope to be done before 11pm so I can be at work early. 

Goodnight!

[Real] (06/04/25) Moments beside the crush
I was already in the classroom when he arrived, taking notes. I felt someone trying to sit in my row, scooted closer to the table and kept taking my notes. After a bit I noticed a male figure in the seat by my side, one that I recognized, and since I didn't noticed anyone else in class, I knew it had to be him. I unconsciously let my pencil fall, and I enjoyed the opportunity to eye my side and check if it was truly him: it was!  
That made me smile. And made me lose focus too: "Why does he only sit near on Wednesdays?", "Maybe he just likes this row?", "Maybe he doesn't like the row I sit in the Monday classroom?", "I'm just overthinking, ain't I?", "Oh, it's just a crush, I shouldn't overthink on him in the middle of class, just appreciate his beautiful existence!". Then I managed to get the attention back to the professor and luckily didn't lost much class content.   
After class, I turned slightly to adjust my backpack and used the moment to sneak a glance at him: he was standing and looking straight ahead as if waiting for me to move so he could pass, so I rushed to get out of the row and ease the way out for him.   
But he didn't: a left 30s after him, and even with that, he managed to walk slowly and by my side.   
I generally walk quickly but I noticed his pace and decided to enjoy the little moment: I matched his pace. At a certain point the corridor was crowed in front of a classroom door and he ended up getting a few steps ahead of me so I enjoyed the moment to stare at his figure a bit. Even from behind I thought him beautiful - even with the lacking size of the butt lol I have eyes!!!! no judgement, pls. That was the moment I noticed I was staring, and had two options: look away or keep checking him out and maybe have someone expose me. I choose the later, obviously, and noticed that: he had a lazy but confident kind of walk, his feet didn't point ahead as he walked (kinda singular that one), he was taller than I had noticed before, his hair had the appearance of being very soft to caress. After passing the little crowd **he** paced to my side again, and we continued at his slow pace. I dared a look at him - to see if I could find a topic to talk about, but he seemed to be in his own world picking a song to listen. When I looked ahead again I saw another little crowd at another classroom door, so decided it was enough and that it had been enjoyable while lasted. I dared another look at him, nothing had change, so I started my normal fast walking pace to my common destination after class: the main bathroom.   
When I looked in the mirror, I was smiling foolishly. The simplicity of it all made me smile a little bit more: I was happy because I allowed myself to be in that moment without expectations, just living it, being present in it, and observing as much as I could. Even if all I really observed was about my little crush.

[Real] (09/06/2025)
Does he care?

Do they care?

Does anyone care?

I don’t think anyone cares.

[Real] (06/08/25) The Visitor
This morning, I looked out into the backyard and locked eyes with a visitor I wasn’t expecting—a red fox, calm and watchful, standing in the open as if she owned the place. She didn’t run. She didn’t hide. She just stood there, holding her ground with a quiet kind of strength.

What the photo doesn’t show is that she wasn’t alone. Just beyond the frame, nestled in the grass near the edge of the tree line, were three fox cubs. Tiny and playful, they stayed close to the underbrush while their mother kept watch. I stood frozen, not wanting to startle them or miss the moment. It felt like a gift.

I found myself wanting to do something, so I grabbed a handful of grapes and tossed them onto the lawn, an offering of sorts. They rolled onto the grass. For a moment, the fox considered them. She didn’t rush or scramble. Just a slow, deliberate movement as she sniffed the air, then turned back toward her cubs. Maybe she didn’t want them; maybe she was teaching them caution, or maybe, like so much in nature, it wasn’t about the food but about the exchange-the quiet acknowledgment that we had seen each other.

There was something deeply moving about it. The way she carried herself—alert, protective, but unafraid—reminded me of how powerful maternal instinct can be. She didn’t need to do anything flashy or aggressive. Just being present, just watching, was enough.

And I wondered: how many wild, beautiful things are out there, just beyond our line of sight? How often do we miss the sacred moments happening right under our noses because we’re too distracted, too hurried, or just not looking?

[Real] (06/08/25) A bright future broken.
Last year, I had a near perfect life. Back then, I was on-track to graduate college with an associate’s degree in June 2025.  While there were issues, it was tolerable. Nowadays, I (F17) feel so broken though. Despite having a head start at college due to my intelligence, I’m slowly falling behind, and I feel that my body and brain is breaking.

I have been having intense trouble managing my physical and mental health issues, barely keeping myself afloat with no degree of normalcy. I have so much fatigue everyday, without even doing much, and even standing can be distressing. I’ve done so much bloodwork, tests, and had many doctor visits; mostly everything is fine. I’ve been told by doctors that it’s simply orthostatic intolerance and the only thing they told me that I’m not already doing is to exercise more. Though, I used to exercise more before it became so exhausting compared to before. For something that is apparently so simple, it’s too distressing to handle sometimes.

That’s not to even mention my mental health issues that I’ve been struggling to deal with alone. I have a therapist, but I feel that I can’t discuss all my issues with her, and I’m too fatigued all the time to decide and look for a different one, if that would even help. I have a concrete idea of which disorders I may have, but a vague idea on how to improve.

As a result of becoming homeschooled last year to have more time for college work, I have become isolated from the few friends I could have reached out for support. I’m reluctant to bother my mother, as she’s dealing with so much by herself, especially my grandfather’s health and recently separating from my father. There’s no one to talk to at all.

All of this and other factors led to me failing courses semester and semester. I feel awful for failing multiple times when I used to complain about even B’s. Yet, realizing I don’t even want to do this, and I don’t know what I want to do, hasn’t helped in my ability to push forward past all my health issues.

These days, I read and try to clean some on good days. Most days, it’s either YouTube, window shopping online, or video games to distract myself from the physical and mental pain. I can see that my future looks terrible now, but I don’t know how to stop it alone.

My fear is that what lies in my future is relying on my mother forever, which will cause her great disappointment, as I had such a brilliant future originally.

[Real] (6/08/25) So overwhelmed with Adulthood
Adulthood is so hard I don't know how the older generations did it. Why they didn't guide the younger ones is also beyond me.
I recently graduated from a 4-year university, grad degree, and my loved ones, who I care for deeply are very happy, but I'm not. My family are all immigrants and they believe simply by having a degree I'm miles ahead than everyone else. I respect it, partly because the United States has been successful at indoctrinating them with the false narrative of the American Dream, but they don't understand. Here are my challenges:
Employment-related woes for individuals with physical disabilities like myself. Even though the state spent thousands of dollars on a degree I'll be surprised if I even manage to get employed part time. Constant discrimination in organizations and the workforce makes it extremely difficult for us to find and keep our jobs. People view the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as a savior almost, as if all the sudden we're immune to discrimination because it exists. I wish that were the case. there are obvious forms, and also not-so-obvious forms of discrimination. Of course, companies want the most productive workers, employees that can meet productivity quotas without much issue, that can slave away at their command simply because they say so. "Reasonable accommodations? What are those" they synically wonder, but they will never voice that. To avoid a lawsuit they'll be nice, but will never call back after an interview though the applicant may be qualified. Work experience, needed to get a job, but to get work experience you need to work, but you can't because you don't have work experience ... I lost count of all the volunteer opportunities I've lost because organizations again, don't want to deal with disabled volunteers who need reasonable accommodations because they can't understand how they can do the job. Needless to say my resume looks almost empty and unimpressive.
Life: prices to everything are very high, disproportionate high taxes which I will have to learn to do at some point if I ever get stable employment and a livable wage, the housing market is ridiculous, constant bills to pay and extreme poverty. Kids, do I even want kids? ... Dare I say more?
Honestly, I resent my parents for not attempting to guide me and my siblings to prepare us for this craziness we call life. Instead they chose to keep us in a bubble, ironically to prevent us from getting hurt based on rational and irrational fears, and here we are. I guess I can excuse the lack of guidance by using the arguments that are so popularly thrown around such as "they did the best they could", "they had it hard", "they didn't know what we know now", "you should do better than them." The least they could have done was allow me to vent my frustrations and fear of the uncertainty without dismissing it but they didn't do that. "Everything will be fine but you're just so negative it's hard for you to understand," they say. Really? In my almost 3 decades of being alive I've witnessed and lived through plenty to validate my own experiences so I do not take well my intelligence being insulted.
It's fine, they can continue to be happy. After all, I don't take full ownership of this "success" because life would be worse if it weren't for them allowing me to live work free while I completed my education. I will continue to learn as much as I can while I can.

[Real] (06/08/2025) The flu
It's a Sunday morning as I'm typing this. I was sick for a full week. I went onto international travel with my coworkers and I must've picked something up. I'm 99% sure it was the flu. Who knows? It sucked so bad. My chest was filled with mucus and god knows what. I got most of it out of my system, but it'll take at least 2 weeks before I'm fully back in gear. I'm just lucky I have trusting and understanding coworkers.

I gotta be back at work tomorrow. I still feel a little out of it from my illness, but I should be okay. Being cooped up in my room for a week wasn't fun at all, but I didn't want anyone else to get sick. The last thing I need is to get into work earlier than usual and spreading whatever it is that I got to the rest of them. My boss even told me, saying, "Whatever it is that you got, keep it with you until you get better. We don't want none of that here, okay?"

I don't really want to talk about politics right now. I'm too exhausted for it. I know what's been going on with current events, but it's too much sometimes. I can only hope this nightmare ends sooner than later. 

I've been working for nearly 4 years at my workplace. It didn't even feel like that amount of time passed me by. A man once told me that if you enjoy the place you work at, it won't feel like work anymore. Maybe he was right.

[Real] (06/07/2025) - 001
Well, it turns out my dream guy wasn’t such a dream after all. I’m fucking relieved more than anything, to be honest. I’m happy to be single again.

[Real] (6/7/25) whoops, I'm in trouble.
Apparently its inappropriate to call my husband while he's working and ask if I can drop $300 on a spinning wheel I totally promised I didnt need and wouldn't buy. He's right, of course. But... it was pretty and I wanted it.

It probably doesnt help that when he said no I said "doing it anyway, love you bye". Whoops.

I did decide I didnt need it this moment. So instead I got fiber, a new spindle, some colorwork cards and some chocolate. Chocolate I have to share, which is fine it was delicious and I want him to experience it too.

So while I am currently in trouble, its nothing I can't smooth over later this afternoon.

Princess was truly incredible today. She behaved, she used her words, she was polite and listened. I had so much fun with her. Festivals arent easy to bring her along for. While we were there about 3 hours, she was a trooper the whole time. I couldnt be more proud of her. I need to teach her to spin though - thats gonna be fun. Hopefully she is able to be patient with it.

She loved meeting the alpaca, goats and sheep. Even the bunnies were super sweet. Considering I told husband I would be bringing home a bunny and I didnt, I should be able to get away with bothering him at work, right?

My new spindle is my next project. Its so pretty. Hand carved, lighter weight than my current spindle. Only thi g I didnt find was a nostepinne, for winding. I can keep using the toilet paper roll, but I would really like a real nostepinne. Might have to see if my FIL would make me one. Should be a quick and relatively easy make.

[real] (6/7/25)
Yesterday while out with A, K, and M… I saw the most handsome man at one of the gay bars here in Hell's Kitchen. I thought he was gay but when he introduced himself to me, told me that he was a straight man there by himself. I was so attracted to him that I just couldn't step away. I had told him to give me his phone so I could put my number in, and told him that even though I am a lesbian, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate beautiful people. 

So he ended up spending the rest of the night hanging out with me and my friends and we bopped around to other gay bars in the area. He told me he plays guitar and writes songs, and doesn't believe in covering other people's music because he could never be as good as them. I found something romantic in that. He was also very protective when some guy tried to push me aside. He got cold at the bar so I let him wear my jacket lol. He asked me what my dreams were and I told him about the rural France and flower shop dream along with my hopes to become a good mom and have a family. 

Later in the night, I told him I couldn't take him home because my apartment was a mess and I couldn't have a guest come over and see all that. Something that I really liked about him was that he was very understanding about my preference for women over men. He wasn't trying to hit on me at all, he just wanted to be friends. Even when I asked him if we should make out, he asked me if I was really sure that I wanted to. I responded to him by saying I was impressed by how thoughtful he was. He then said "maybe we should wait until later to see if you really want to". I thought he wasn't into it but he reassured me he was and we did end up making out on the dance floor. But that's when it was confirmed yet again that I definitely am gay and we high fived each other and just kept dancing. 


So we parted ways a little after midnight. He's a tennis partner for professionals and had an early morning deep in Long Island the next day at the club. He told me he's Brazilian and speaks Portuguese's an has been here for one week. He lived in NYC for a year a few years back but it seems like he's really just trying to figure out how to have fun now that he's back. He's a 33 year old Gemini sun and I think we're going to be very good friends.

[REAL] (06/07/25) The Routine: "Alchemist's Cipher"- 2nd Formula
  Got a new Christian radio station on Pandora. It's very nice; the genre has made such great progress, and it has it own subgenres, or rather has become a subgenre of other genres now, truly. Recomendations to build the playlist Courtesy of the two beautiful sisters from Temple.
   The usual coffee, and today chocolate graham cracker/peanut butter cookies; fish oil capsules and magnesium. Obviously cannabis as it helps with pain management and mental focus (better than other treatment options for my health). I've finished all of my other supplement regimens and this one, though it is simple, is a great system after one has healed most of their body. My third eye can light up, and my nervous system can flag and signal me now, I can sense the static energy of others around me. I use and wear jewelry that captures and redirects energy/grounds me and insulates me. I've told myself for the last 5 years that I was going to start experiencing this change and the things I would reward myself with once I could manifest it and achieve it. Now it is like it is achieving itself.
  Morgan Wallen, Teddy Swims, and a couple other artists snuck their way on there; and I thought of pops, and I was okay with it, it was like he was telling me from heaven it's okay to keep these parts of myself. I'm about to study more scripture and maybe do some meditation over the things I find. The sisters also gave me a prayer to read to gain understanding and affirmation/confirmation that the scripture is real. I do enjoy reading it alot. I also got the full apocrypha, and I am having my brother listen to that with me when he wants; I am having him start with the book of Enoch; it is my favorite. 
  I think I'm gonna do a small workout;( upper body/core), then maybe play some games later. 
I will have to "get to work" soon; but I'm not really worried about it...
  It's nice to be able to let go of that stress. It does amaze me how well I bounce back, everytime. Everytime I come back from the wilderness, I return smarter and stronger, wiser. 
I want to go out and look at the stars, I wonder if there will be a clear sky tonight... 
  You know, this was all of the knowledge and love I wanted to share with someone; I really wished it would have been with the people I had to leave behind; I didn't belong to them and they didn't belong with me. Hopefully this leads me to my forever family...
  I was at the local market, I wondered if I could sell my jewelry at events like that and others; it wouldn't be a bad idea...
  My writings seem to be Improving too, I just might start taking prompts soon. Then I am, I am finishing my books in the future. 
  All of the prisms are falling into place...
  The friction is starting to slip away...

[real] (06/05/2025)
Yesterday, I called my gym to cancel membership. They told me I had to do that in person. I got up and got ready. Then on my way out, I saw cat waiting for food. I figured, I’d stop by the dollar tree on my way there and grab him something. I also brought my gallon jug, as the water store is also in the same vicinity. So I headed out. It was a very bright, sunny afternoon. 

Once back, I headed to bed to relax before work. 

At about 9:20pm, I got up to change and ate rolled chicken tacos. My mom was on her way out of the driveway, so she said she was already going in that direction. I went with her. I got there early. 

We had a good day at work. I walked home from work and made it at 4:44am. We all got home, safe.

[real] (6/6/25) is it just me?
Is it just me or y'all go through the pain of fighting for one person in front of everyone, only to see them disappoint you. Today, I feel that. I've been quite elated lately when I was talking about my weekends and spending time with someone I really like. But, yesterday felt like shit. It felt as if he's still the same guy who I had left back then. Plus, he didn't bother to respond to my insecurities and just responded with, "you keep talking to yourself, I'm gonna sleep" I don't know if thats even funny lmao. How are you so unhinged about everything and anything? 

Also, I don't want any unsolicited advice on how I should leave him, we aren't even together like that. But, it hurts. I feel bad that I still get affected by him so much. Idk what to do anymore, maybe leaving this place will solve things ( since my course ends in June).

I hate HATE his way of dealing with problems. 
If you, I mean you! If you ever get to this post, just know - running away from confrontation won't ever take you anywhere. Only being honest can help you, no relationship can be built on the foundations of lies. I hope you understand this, you've lost way too many people because you didn't understand this, in time.

[Real] (06/05/2025) I slept beside my mom in the hospital, now I’m in a quiet house that doesn’t feel like home.
My mom slipped again—this time in the shower. She used her injured leg to stand, and it fractured under her. The same leg that’s been fighting off pain for months… the same one they found cancer in just days ago. I watched her cry through it, her face twisted in pain I couldn’t take away. That night I stayed with her at the hospital. I barely slept. The cold lights never turned off. Her hand felt smaller than usual when I held it. Everything felt like it was fading—like a slowed loop playing over and over, soft but breaking.

This morning, I woke up to nurses tending to her, gently turning her broken body. I stayed still. Then I went home in a taxi, and now while my sister stayed with her, I’m here. In a silent house that used to feel warm. Schoolwork has been throwing bricks at me, and college is stressing me out, but all I can think about is my mom—still in that bed, still in pain. I feel like I’m living someone else’s life. Everything’s moving, but I’n stuck. Just floating in static.

I have been his friend for three years, but what if he doesn’t like me?

We have flirted with each other from the very first moment we met. We have spent hours and hours in small spaces together, collaborating and creating and joking and teasing and bonding. I have lost track of how many ways he has found to have an excuse to touch me, brushing past me or “inadvertently” maneuvering me into a corner. Once he insisted on tying an apron around my waist while standing in front of me. We both have probably been a bit too obvious about making sure that we wind up sitting next to each other. 

For Christmas one year we did a White Elephant gift exchange. I picked his gift, stole it from the person who had pulled it. Granted, it wasn’t a bad gift, but also I just wanted to have it. Something of his, something intended for a person he cared about. 

This last year for Christmas, we didn’t do an exchange. I don’t know if he got gifts for other people in our friend group. But he got one for me. He brought it to me at work, going out of his way to make sure that he could watch me open it. 

I was about to move three thousand miles away, which is probably why. 

But it was still the most thoughtful gift I’ve ever been given. 

When he brought it to me, I gave him a tour of my work (an historical building), and we stood in the dimly-lit cavernous main room together in awed silence for a moment. And then he hugged me. He said, “I can’t believe you’re going. You can’t go.” As if he was saying, please don’t go. As if he was saying, I don’t want you to go. I walked him back up to the main entrance. We hugged several more times. 

But I don’t know if he likes me. 

I saw him again on a trip back to my hometown, an unpleasant trip but it was made much brighter by being in that room again with those friends again. With him. I asked, are you traveling anywhere soon? He said, to see my parents, not far from you. For a month at the start of summer, while I teach online. He said, if I can swing the trip I’d love to come visit. Or you can come up to me. 

But I don’t know if he likes me. 

I texted him a few days ago, knowing that he was on his visit. I said, there’s a very neat city that’s about the halfway point between us, in case you were wondering. He said, You’re right! And I need a break. Work is nonstop. He asked, if I can steal the car would you meet me on Saturday?

Yes. Yes. Yes I will. 

He said, I’ll get a hotel room. 

But. I don’t know what he wants. I don’t know if he likes me. Maybe this is just beers. Maybe this is just sleepover with friends. Maybe this is just museums and parks and a nice lunch on a Saturday, then we sleep and then we part. 

I don’t know. 

But I hope.

[real] (6/5/25)
Got over 16k steps in yesterday, and am very proud of myself. During my evening walk by the river, I had this almost sad, nostalgic, sentimental (I can't quite explain it) feeling of regret about romantic relationships. Not any one in particular, but that the best version of myself I could ever give to someone will only be as good as I am in that moment we are together. And it's the same way for the other person. That is, we can both work hard to become better versions of ourselves, but it's really just pure luck of the draw that those versions are willing to accept and love one another for who they are at that one point in time.

So if I ever became a better version of myself that was finally good "enough" for someone else's standards, it might be too late. But I guess that's love after all. You have to be willing to love that person for all their strengths and weaknesses and want to grow with them.

So in this space, it really is just luck that we find our person. They have to be in the right mindset, emotional space, and place in life. Just as we have to be in the right mindset, emotional space, and place in life. And both individuals have to somehow connect on a level that transcends their individuality.

[Real] (06/05/2025) This school break, I feel extremely happy and giddy. I'm afraid it's about to end soon.
Today's school break has been the best. This was the first time I've lived in a good house: it has tons enough of space to walk on and it doesn't flood from medium-heavy rains. I also finally had a room to stay in!

I was able to bond with my old friends through chat (although I'm sure we'd still be awkward irl), and I was able to bond with my mom more as well. I also got to talk with my dad at some times.

I also got into the hobby of making pan cookies, and lately we started making shawarma wraps with my mom which is smth I love!

I also went out one time with my friends where we watched Bet (Meariri and Yumekira ftw btw).

Although I rarely went out and I wasn't able to study all of the topics needed for the college entrance exam (which is something I need to do omg fuck someone help me), it was overall a really fun break. Which is why I'm really dreading the looming school year

[Real] (6/5/25) Spontaneity
Considering its 6:30 and I'm here instead of getting ready for work, that means one of two things: its going horribly bad, or its going insanely well.

I was chilling this morning, had just woke up, gathering the energy to get up and shower. Husband comes in, like he always does, and leans down to kiss me before he goes to work. I typically dont even put my phone down. But this... this was different. I'm not sure what got into this man this morning, but I could get used to this. He kept saying he had to go to work, so I took his badge. He didnt fight me at all, just playful opposition that very quickly went away. "Oh darn, guess I'll have to stay here with you". Only to then take it back the moment I let it go to grip the sheets. That might have been the best unexpected morning I've had in years. Definitely something thats going to be playing in my mind all day.

With a promise of more tonight, and a very serious "threat" to take him to lunch and have a quickie in my car, he had to leave. We're 30 minutes behind our normal schedule. I don't care. This is a good reason to be behind. Im happy, Im loved.

[Real] (06/05/2025) day 120+
He’s made it over 120 days sober. It’s certainly nice so far. Everything has changed and it’s for the better. Now I need to focus more on myself and heal what’s wrong with me as so much has changed. 

I want to write so much more. But I still can’t open up more so. I’ll get there. Until then …

[Real] (06/05/25) What makes love?
To the void,

Everything for me is intense. It’s as intense as it gets. I see a woman, and I’m completely enamored. All it takes is a few pictures, a video or even a post showing just a hint of her personality, and I’m smitten. That’s all it takes. “That’s unhealthy” “That’s just infatuation” trust me I know I’ve heard all the things. Unfortunately though, that’s just the way my brain is wired, those are the cards I was dealt.You see EVERYTHING for me is intense, so whatever I feel in the moment, I feel it as strongly as anybody has ever felt anything. It is both my mental curse and I could argue my greatest strength. It is not something I could cure but only hope to manage.  So how will I know, like TRULY know, if I’m in love with someone if everything is already more intense. Will it just be MORE intense? Will it be just as intense but the intensity lasts forever? As time goes on she no longer just invades my daily thoughts, but now she courses through my veins?? Her presence doesn’t just put a fire in my chest, but it burns through to my soul??? All of this just makes me wonder… what makes love? 

Is it simply the depth of affection and desire you feel for someone? Is it the amount of adverse circumstances you’re willing to stand with somebody through? Or perhaps love is your actions, the selfless things you’re willing to do for someone with no other purpose in mind besides making their experience better on this Earth. I feel like maybe that’s the only true way to measure love in this world. With people like myself here we cannot strictly qualify love by the strength and intensity of one’s feelings. For if that’s all it took, could I not say with absolute certainty that I’ve loved complete strangers more than even their closest companions and confidants. That doesn’t make sense to me. 

But then again, I would make my life worse in an instant if it meant I could assist somebody I don’t know just to make their life better for a brief moment in time. Does this mean I’m just brimming with love for everybody? That I just need somebody who’s cup is overflowing with love as well, and we could give each other the love we so passionately give to everyone around us? I want to love and be loved, as I think that’s the truest thing a human can experience. But I’m afraid I’ll never get the real thing as I just settle for the first person to give even an ounce of the love I share back to me. So for a person like myself I ask again… What makes love?

[real] (06/04/2025)
If you have to give up everything, is it worth it?

[REAL] (06/05/2025) Well, there goes our happiness
I don’t even know what to say.

I always knew anyway… that this was nothing but mere daydreams. Too good to be true. I don’t know.

Everything is too loud yet I don’t know what to say. I’m just really exhausted.

Well, it was nice while it lasted.

[real] (06/04/2025) chilled drinks &amp; dragonflies
It's one of those ridiculously long summer evenings. I live quite far up north so the sun sets around 11 PM now. A few small clouds drift by in the distance against the backdrop of the golden evening sky. A dragonfly lands beside me as I take another sip of my iced tea. 

I had a good conversation with my friend last Saturday. We were at the lookout point high up on a hill, from where you can look over our entire city. I was talking about my insecurities, how I feel like I'm not really part of the group, I'm just an accessory that nobody really cares about, and how after hanging out with them I always feel mentally exhausted.

He gave me some tough love. He said I shouldn't take things that seriously. That he can tell that I really care about the people, but those people might have different values in friendships, and different expectations. And that maybe I shouldn't have such specific expectations.

At first I didn't want to hear it, and I just kinda cut the conversation short after that. But I think deep down I knew that he meant well, and moreover, that he had a point. I can't expect others to show that they care about me in exactly the way I want. We're all different, and that's perfectly fine, in fact, that's a good thing.

So I took his advice to heart and took things a little easier this week. And shit, it's really lifted the pressure off. I feel a lot calmer now, in general. And I'm not 100% there yet, but I think this could be the start of a really positive change.

[real] (06/03/2025)
I spent most of the day watching content from DiscerningMan, working out, then getting ready for burgers with my coworkers and friends: Terri and Erik. It really did take me all afternoon, evening and past midnight, but I took my time was inspired, and had time to take care of finer details. 

Afterwards, we ordered our burgers, sat down, and ate. They chatted about work concerns and new drinks. I think we all relaxed a good bit, then we headed home. I went to sleep shortly after.

[real] (3/06/25) Got TWO TATTOOS Within an Hour of Decision, After Months of Meaning Finding — I Did It Yesterday.
Today felt like one of those days where everything aligned in a strange, unplanned way. On a random Tuesday, within an hour, I decided I wanted to get two tattoos—tattoos that would stay with me till the moment I die, and even after that. It felt impulsive, almost like a heat-of-the-moment decision, but the truth is that the meaning behind these tattoos had been brewing inside me for over a year.

The first tattoo is of a dandelion with butterflies flying out. There’s something so beautifully symbolic about it—hope, freedom, and the art of letting go. Letting go is something I’ve always struggled with, but this tattoo reminds me that it’s okay, that release can be healing too.

The second tattoo is a quote—François Rabelais’s last words - "I go to seek a great perhaps." He spoke of the “great perhaps,” the hope of an unpredictable but beautiful afterlife. He didn’t think he needed to live cautiously to reach that great perhaps. I resonated with those words so deeply that they felt like the only thing worth engraving on my skin.

Today, I’m proud of myself. I took a leap, trusted my instincts, and chose to mark my journey with symbols of courage and strength. These tattoos aren’t just ink—they’re reminders that I’m more than my scars. ( those that I really don't wanna talk about) So, Cheers to that. I'm sure my younger self would be proud that I'm fighting for my own self everyday, that I'm the rebel who didn't give up in face of adversity, that I dared to do what I dream of. Ofc, there's a lot more to my dreams than just tattoos. Step by step, I shall fulfill all. ♥️

[Real] (6/3/25) Had I known..
If I had known I wasn't going to sleep I would have finished my second sock.

I'm exhausted. Going solo at work again has been rough, I have 5 different items at critical level, all being escalated well above me. Im just trying to keep it all straight. I'm just tired, I hit my limit.

Princess is being amazing. This little girl is my stabilizing force right now. She just wants to play, she wants to have fun. Husband is being a total godsend, helping keep her under control, being my rock and solid place to land. I'm left to work through things on my own, but I know he's there if I need to bounce things off him.

Found out he has to work this weekend, so poisoned and I are going to the fiber festival just the girls. He felt so guilty because he thought this was my solo festival weekend. I'm more than happy to take Princess solo. Though I was told if I brought home a bunny he would turn it into stew... I'm displeased at that proposition. 

I'm really going they have some used spindles and maybe an e spinner. Plus of course more fiber. Once I'm done with these socks, I'm making a doll for my mom.

[real] (6/3/25)
Lately I find myself outgrowing people. I no longer care about a lot of things that the younger crowd is doing and I feel like I've graduated from baby gay enough to not want to go out all the time and pick girls up. Nor do I really care about being part of the dating game. 

Advice from those in their 20s just doesn't work for me anymore and I know that my advice doesn't work for them either. 

I also just really wanna focus on my diet and health because it just doesn't seem to be getting better. 

I like not having a lot of plans in the week and spending time with just myself or only close people, and not having to drink. 

I suppose I'm finally catching up to my age.

[REAL] (06/04/2025) Emotionally Bloated and Constipated
First off, I kind of wish writing was my job. I know I didn’t pursue my field in college after graduating because I honestly got burnt out from all the writings and research. And that was during when AI wasn’t discovered yet. So I was really just milking off every ideas I could possibly produce from my mind, and with the help of research.

The best tool I got was Grammarly, and I didn’t even use it that much back then. I was relying heavily on my sheer skill of proficiency—the hardcore grammar Nazi that I was. But that was back then. Eons ago. My grammar now is… decent? I don’t know.

I have never been confident with my articulation. I always have this disclaimer whenever I talk to people I deem smart or whatever that I’m not really that articulate. That it has been ages since I felt like I was articulate. But I appreciate it when they tell me that I actually am, and I appreciate it even more when I can feel that they are being genuine with their comment—not just merely saying “Oh, what do you mean? You are articulate! You’ve got a good head on your shoulders” just to appease me or make me feel good or whatever. But lately though, I just feel like my articulation is just deteriorating even more.

I feel like my English is deteriorating.

In a way, I kind feel like the deterioration is because of my exhaustion. Like, I don't know. I have a lot of thoughts in my head, but I feel emotionally constipated? Both emotionally bloated and constipated that I can't let the emotions out because I don't know how I would convey them. I'm fumbling for words extra hard than I normally do.

And right now, I hate it when I rely a little too much on AI tools—even for simple responses. Like WTF? Okay, like in my defense… I still have drafts of responses, writings, and whatever else that I definitely write. But I feel like they’re too raw, too chaotic, too all over the place that I really just need to have them always run by a tool so that they’re perfect. I mean, it’s not like I’m writing a mighty dissertation that I need perfect writings. Most of the time, these are just random personal essays I make and responses to letters. Those stuff don’t always need to be perfect. Having them a little messy make them land, right?

Well, I wanted to say whenever I talk to this friend, I find myself just fumbling hard on words. Am I forcing myself to talk to them? I don’t think I am. I really do enjoy our chat exchanges, our letters. But it’s just that, even our casual conversations I would find myself reaching out for a tool. Things is, this friend and I never ever have like a really casual conversation. Our daily musings really turn into long-ass letters. So the longer they get, I resort to using a tool so that my responses can be refined for flow and grammar in order for them to be palatable reads.

I don’t know. I’m rambling. As I should? I mean, this is the point of a journal, no?

Anyway. That being said, my reliance on these AI tools is making me feel like my English is deteriorating. Before this exhaustion that I am in now, when I run my writings to have them polished, I compare the refined writings to my raw writing. And it makes quite happy when I see that there would be little polishing done. But now, I just feel like with the same prompts and deep writing analysis prompts, the tools change my writing a lot. And that's just making me feel like my English is deteriorating. And I just hate it because I do love English. I may not be fluent at it, but I know I have a good grasp of the language enough to be able to write like before.

And I guess I am defaulting to more casual and less precise wording because I am exhausted. And it makes me feel bad because I know I have quite a good vocabulary. It's not Captain Holt proficient, but my vocabulary is still quite enough for me to convey my thoughts... before. Not now I don't seem to have it.

I don’t know.

Or when you’re too much of a perfectionist as well… I don’t know. I don’t know what to say. But it’s tiring how even the tiniest things you obsess over. Haha, even with my journals, I make sure they’re articulate, they flow properly. And that’s really not the point of journals, is it? It’s a place for you to put yourself, your raw genuine self.

Wow. Just wow.

Look at how my chronic performative ways have made me slip in and out of exhaustion, that lately I’m really just spiraling deeper and deeper into exhaustion. I really am too hard on myself.

And as much as I don’t want to run this journal through any tool for refinement or whatever, I’m leaving it here. Just raw. Just, what the fuck ever.

[real] (3/6/25) Didn't start out wanting it on reddit but why not.
I remember when I was younger I used to think to myself if I do this and if I do that then I’ll finally be happy. I think I’ve always known that was bullshit. I think that I accepted that I’ll always be chasing something, but at least that’ll keep me busy from thinking about the emptiness I have within me.



After a bit of soul searching; if you believe in that type of thing (I don’t). I figured I can’t live my life based on what other people want for me. 

They wanted a uni level education, a wife and kids and grandkids. Some inordinate house in a nice neighborhood, with white fences and a dog named snowy… or whatever bullshit they thought was normal. They wanted for me something they never got. 

In some way I understand that.



I remember telling my dad that I didn’t want to be a psychologist, that I didn’t want to go to uni; at least until I had something to go for.

I’ve never felt more disappointment in myself, but that was the first step in reclaiming my life. The next logical step came a couple of months later when I told him I was gay. I still don’t know what he was more disappointed in to be frank.



The rest of my family was a bit better with that news than he was, but they still had hopes for uni, and some for grandkids. I can’t even handle myself let alone a smaller version of me, or of someone else more likely.

No, I still needed to figure out myself before I could even think of that. As “teen angst, and stereotypical” of me to do that is. I’m a walking parody of myself in that regard. The troubled friend in a coming of age film that doesn’t help themselves.

 

Fucking ideot more like it. 

Of course I’m being dramatic, lifes not a movie, nore is it romantic and nothing ever falls into place because there's not a director making things happen, or a screenwriter making some long winded point. No, life is not easy, not for me, not for anyone. We can’t be defined by our environments as much as we like to blame our meth head mothers or alcoholic fathers.



Anyway, these days I want to see a therapist again. Last time it helped with my anxiety, and as much as I would have liked to have focused on my; what I can only assume is depression… I had limited time with that therapist. Money and moving houses put a time limit on what I could do.



I had to ask my nan and pop; who I live with now, for money to see the therapist once every 2 weeks because it cost too much. Thankfully it wasn’t for naught. I still get anxious, but I can actually function if I so choose too.



Right now I have one goal, That’s getting my license. After that, it’s finding a job, and studying to become a real estate agent. I hate real estate agents, and rich people in general. I especially hate people buying properties as investments and to rent as slumlords.

Fuck those people.



Yet I don’t see myself hating doing the job of a real estate agent as I do with most other jobs, and as much as I hate to admit it to myself, the money sounds nice too.

I still have the problem of an overwhelming emptiness, and some days a hazy nothingness. I need to help my mind before I do any other goals after those 2. Like finding a partner. I can’t love someone if I don’t love myself.



It’s something I’ve only after 19 years of living got the idea of. Loving, or even liking myself. I need to accept I’m ok with being ok.

I think I, and others like me are often saboteurs in our lives. With relationships we find a reason to get out of them, or to ruin them, with family we find reasons to hate them, with friends we don’t even get close to. We isolate ourselves in every form because it’s easier than accepting kindness from anyone in any shape or from.



I’m still learning these things on my own, but a professional would surely help. These days I’ve regressed into a coping mechanism that isn’t always consistent, but is easy to try; enjoying the little things. My go to is coffee. Coffee to me is a warm hug, it’s the beginning of my day and the end. It’s what I can look forward to. I love drinking it, even bad coffee. I like to appreciate the sweetness, savour the bitterness, and hold close to me the hot mug.



Another way I’m helping myself is doing more things physically. I don’t mean exercise. I'll join a gym when I get a car and can go late at night. No, I mean stop doing everything digitally. I’ve recently ordered a walkman to listen to some tapes I have, and I might set up my record player again. I also got a huge handmade book, and an ink and dip pen. It’s something to keep me grounded in reality. Something real and tangible and able to lose.



I want to join a charity, something hands-on, but nothing in my area speaks to me, and it all requires some time and commitment that I can’t promise.

I’ll find something eventually, but until then I’ll just have to keep my mind occupied differently.



Some days are getting easier, other days I just want to cry. I talk to a close friend sometimes, but there's only so much talking will do vs action I can take. 

Most of all, I tend to be self destructive, and I haven't for a while and I’m feeling the effects of that. I used to drink not often, but quite a lot when I did.It’s been almost half a year since I did anything reckless to myself, besides starting smoking. I figure compared to my most likely inherited addictive personality, smoking nicotine and tobacco free fags wouldn’t be the worst habit to replace drinking with. Beats hangovers and vomiting on myself. And now that I use sleeping pills, it's probably best not to bring vodka into that mix. I’m not rockstar enough to die that way.



Even still I feel so wound up by normalcy. I wake up and get dressed and have a routine and I hate it. I didn’t realize I craved discomfort and chaos, but I do. 



Thankfully I feel less inclined to hurt myself these days. Even though I did it recently, It wasn’t as bad as I did in the past. You know something people don’t often talk about is how addictive hurting yourself is.

At first it starts with hands in boiling water or other discomforts that aren't as visible as cuts, but then you cut the palm of your hand, and then your wrist, and soon enough you drunkenly hack at your arm with a blunt leatherman trying to kill yourself only to realise you can barely even hit your arm in the same place, let alone cut a vain with the equivalent of a butter knife.



That all being said, at least no one ever caught me. No one noticed the cuts or the scars. And that honestly saves me a lot of effort.

That being said, people still know I’m in some kind of mental condition not fit for a coconut. But they give me space and that’s all I can ask for. 

I don’t know why I can’t talk to even some of the people closest to me, but I can rant to strangers. Probably because I have nothing to lose. But that theory falls flat considering I told a close friend about pretty much everything. I just get attached to some people for whatever reason.

[Real] (6/2/2025) I’m Remembering
TW// VERY brief ED mention

In the last year or so, I (25F) realized that I do not have many memories of my high school years. It’s a combination of things I think. A budding ED, a toxic friendship, and a deeply painful mentorship do not a good experience make; but I didn’t expect to just lose it. I know what happened broadly, but I have very few specific memories of only high school. Middle school and college are much clearer to me.

I started high school in a friendship that still has a massive effect on my relationships today, and likely will forever - regardless of therapy. Nothing I could ever do was right with her: I was too mean, or too sad, or I didn’t say the right thing, or I couldn’t fix a problem for her and it was my fault. I always knew why she was like that - she definitely wasn’t doing well herself - but it never occurred to me until recently that it had nothing to do with me. We were friends for 5 years, and the whole time I was absorbing what she said and taking it as the truth. When we were in middle school once, she put me in a group chat on kik (nothing good happened on kik) and sent a number of long paragraphs about how all of them hated me, and I was so mean and negative and not fun to be around. But despite everyone else telling me that they didn’t agree at all and she just did that herself, I believed HER. I, at 13, was the worst person ever, and would only continue to be until I cut her off at 18. The reason I cut her off, actually, is related to the bigger cause of this… blackout, I guess.

Cringe, I know, but I did theatre in high school. And college. And there’s a universe out there where I’m still doing it now. All my life, I wanted to do theatre. Growing up, I was always encouraged to perform. I’d tried dance classes and guitar lessons and cheer and voice lessons, and the one that really stuck was voice. At nine, I started attending voice lessons every Thursday. Every year after that until I was 15, I did summer music camps. I’d always wanted to be a performer - a singer and an actor. Then I met Ms. G. I wouldn’t know this until I was in too deep, but Ms. G had a reputation for not being nice to the girls. She had a… preference for the boys, you could say. She never did anything untoward, but she certainly liked the boys a lot better. But when I saw Seussical: The Musical, I knew I wanted to work with her. I wanted to do musical theatre. So I ask her what I should try to do in the next show, and she tells me Assistant Stage Manager. Cool! I just want to be involved! So I do it, and I like it okay. But I start dating one of the Theatre Boys. The musical comes and I chicken out of auditioning - everyone else seems so good. Plus, that friend from earlier was auditioning. I couldn’t take away her shot. I ASM again, it’s fine. She convinces me to partner up in leadership with my boyfriend at the time, and despite my hesitancy, I do it. When he breaks up with me two months later, he unofficially leaves his position, and so it becomes my fault when our work falls to the wayside. To the point where she told me directly that it’s my fault if we can’t communicate - despite my screens of unanswered texts to him. I cried in the bathroom that day. When I wanted to leave the position the following year, her and that friend seemed to come together to convince me not to. I would be betraying the team AND her if I did, and how could I do that? The following year, I audition for the musical. I receive a different crew role that I did not ask for. I’m not on the cast list, and it breaks my heart but I get it. Sobbing, I email her asking what I can do better next time. She replies, she left me off the cast list by mistake. Whatever. I was ensemble, which was fun. When she’s choosing our senior year musical, she tells me I HAVE to audition, there’s the perfect role for me. It’s a boy role, but for vocal reasons, casting a girl was better, as he’s very young. When the time comes around, i’m hesitant to audition again - I didn’t get chosen last time and I didn’t get chosen for competition, so I must not actually be good. I tell her I want to help her direct it. She tells me no, that if I apply for director and don’t audition, she will not include me at all. I audition, I fight for that role tooth and nail. Then a boy auditions - 15 and already hitting puberty. He can’t sing the song, but he gets it anyway. I’m set to lead a crew that she told me outright “nobody applied for, and I knew you would do it if I asked.” I pray that I was left off the cast list again by accident, but no. I spent a year preparing, not of my own accord, for nothing. I have not performed on a stage since high school.

Ms G’s opinion meant so much to me that it changed the way I allowed myself to dream. Her validation meant more than even my parents’, and certainly more than my own.

I did go to college for theatre, but I’d sworn off performing by that point. I quit voice lessons after I hadn’t gotten cast, and chose to go to college for directing. If I couldn’t perform, at least I could tell others how to, right? We were required to take acting classes. My professor, thank you Mr. A, told me for the first time in Years that I was TALENTED. He said I could be a leading lady, and he wanted to see me play Hedda Gabler someday. It was so nice to hear, but I couldn’t believe him. I never performed in anything in college either. By the time I graduated, I resented theatre and couldn’t stand to watch plays anymore. I still can’t, really.

I worked in retail a while. Not anymore, i’m in an office job now. But i’ve been thinking a lot about how I let myself down. Me at nine would be so sad i’m not acting the house down at 25.

It doesn’t sound like much, when typing it out, but it was enough to break me down completely. By the time I got to college, I didn’t have my own identity. It wasn’t until after I graduated that I even began to form one, and i’m still working on it now. I’m trying to work on fitting myself to what others want, instead letting myself disagree and have my own thoughts.

I don’t know if this is anything, i’m exhausted and I gardened. but i’ve needed to brain dump for days.

[real] (6/3/25)
I walked through CP today and ended up at Turtle Pond where I saw a beautiful sunset behind the backdrop of Belvedere Castle, and counted the little turtles in the pond too. I think I hit 21 at a certain point. 

I finished my second rewatch of Discovery of Witches and Satu, the character I hate, reminds me of M. Even the accent and facial features look similar. I'm glad I'm not watching it anymore because I really don't care for the reminder. 

I think I'm going to cut out prebiotics and probiotics to see what that does for my bloating. 

I've been too sleepy these past thirty hours. I probably accidentally took two melatonins last night, which is why I slept so much today. 

I found out tonight J is a Taurus. Maybe that's why I'm interested in her lol.

Saudades

1. Saudade is a deep emotional state of melancholic nostalgia and longing for something or someone that one cares about. It's a sentimental yearning that combines sadness and affection, often related to a past experience, place, or person.

2. Saudade[a] (English: /saʊˈdɑːdə/;[2] plural saudades) is a word in Portuguese and Galician denoting an emotional state of melancholic or profoundly nostalgic longing for a beloved yet absent someone or something. It derives from the Latin word for solitude.[3] It is often associated with a repressed understanding that one might never encounter the object of longing ever again. It is a recollection of feelings, experiences, places, or events, often elusive, that cause a sense of separation from the exciting, pleasant, or joyous sensations they once caused. 3. Meaning of Saudade (feminine noun): Feeling of nostalgia caused by the absence of something, someone, or a place, or by the desire to relive past experiences, situations, or moments.

4.Saudades: the love that remains

5.Saudade: memory of something with a desire for it.

Have you ever felt such an immense saudade that it squeezed your heart, not because the person died, but because you're no longer in touch? That's what I'm experiencing. When I was 5, I moved to a new city, and he was my first friend. He was my best friend for a long time; we'd spend afternoons playing, and he'd give me little gifts like rocks for my fish tank or treats for my cat. I especially remember one day when we went to his beach house; it was the first time I saw hail. We were around 8 years old, and we were in the pool when it started raining. Everyone else got out, but we hid under a bridge that went over one side of the pool. Maybe I had a crush on him, and I like thinking about that. Later that day, when we were playing with his siblings, he didn't want to heat up noodles to impress me. His brother teased him, saying something like, "You're eating cold noodles to impress your girlfriend?" We both felt awkward, and I laughed at him.

A year later, I experienced bullying in our class. I was a girl who only hung out with boys, and one girl I did ballet with, whom I thought was my friend, turned on me. She started talking about me and made all my friends distance themselves from me. They'd get up from the table whenever I sat down with them, saying I wasn't a "real girl" because I hung out with boys. They called me ugly and childish. I listened to it all, and it was a very difficult year. I'd come home crying every day. My mom spoke to the school psychologist, who talked to our class, and I cried in front of everyone. Never again.

When it all started, I didn't want to be friends with boys anymore; I wanted to be friends with girls, to be normal. Since moving to the city, I'd only been in that class, surrounded by the same people. I changed classes and kept in touch with some friends for a while, but eventually, I lost touch with all of them, except not really, because my best friend wasn't part of that group anymore. Maybe he felt betrayed; I don't know, and I didn't care back then. It's been 6 years since we last spoke. I changed schools. I've greeted some of those friends when I ran into them, but not him. I still haven't mustered the courage. And I still love him very much. I feel so much saudade for him, but no matter how hard I try, I still can't bring myself to talk to him. The most I've done is follow him on Instagram and like a birthday story he reposted. Still, all my phone widgets are about us. Whenever I see something related to friendship, I think of him. Whenever I see something related to childhood, I think of him. I dreamed about him last year; he hugged me, and I think about that feeling a lot. The other day, I saw him reposting a story from his girlfriend, and all I could think was, "I wonder if he remembers me?" Despite all this, admitting all this, I still can't message him. I just can't. I feel many saudades.

I define saudades at the beginning of this text because, unlike missing someone, which I also feel, I feel saudades. And saudades isn't an action; it's a feeling, a feeling I have for him that hurts much more than missing him. It's a feeling that's not easy to express or explain without the word saudades. Saudades isn't easy to explain; there's no corresponding word in any other language besides Portuguese for such a feeling. There is not just one meaning of longing, and it is these feelings that make my feelings for my best friend so complex.

[real] (6/2/2025) My first time writing about my feelings (21Y)
1.The thing what I released was that I won't see you...It hurts...I didn't realize how much it really hurts to not see you...yeah sure I can see through screen as a video or photo, but it doesn't feel same as a seeing you in real life...maybe this doesn't matter to you..and that's fine...I wanted to say more how much I feel towards you, but I can't because I don't want to seem to attach or creepy...I couldn't say things to what I really wanted...or do things what we wanted...you probably forgot about me and I can't do nothing about it ..you have new friends even partner to live happily for ever..and I'm happy for you...you got to the school what you dream about... 2.

[Real] (02/06/2025)
How did i end up here? Is this really better than the alternative? Surrounded by ghosts and madmen? They just wander the halls, looking like they're lost souls with unfinished business. I wish i could help them. But what does that say about me if i'm in here with them? Which one am i? A ghost? Or a madman?

As i find myself in this pit of despair, i want to talk to K so badly. I want to tell her everything that has happened in the past week. How i ended up at the hospital. How badly i desperately need to talk to someone before i lose my mind. The only meaningful interaction i've had today is with the doctors. And i just feel like i'm drowning in a void.

I'm happy i was able to wish her a happy birthday though. That meant the world to me. Being able to talk to her. I wish she knew how much i had been looking forward to that day. I'm also hoping i get the chance to wish her a happy birthday next year, and hopefully do more. I'm scared because i don't know if i've burned that bridge. I haven't heard from her in a while since i sent my last message, and my brain is going into overthinking mode. I just hope she's not upset with me.

I read to pass the time. There's nothing here to do but wait. Wait for the nurses to bring your medication. Wait for the resident asshole to piss everyone off while acting like a damn child. Wait for the doctors to tell me how much longer i'll be here for. Waiting to hear if i'll be given the chance to just exist or not. Waiting to hear if i'll be able to get the help i need or not. Wait. Wait. Wait.

[real] (06/01/2025) My day, so far:
I slept a lot.
I had breakfast (yesterday’s leftovers).
I drank apple juice.
I took note of my daily needs (today was fresh drinking water, house clean, and workout.)
I considered my schedule (I work at twelve in the morning, the next day).
My mom was washing her car when she told me her pressure gun came apart. I took a look and realized that a tiny “set screw” was missing. She suggested the local hardware store. I got my things ready to go with her, seeing the opportunity to stop by the dollar tree for a bottle of water and juice (these two stores are right besides each other). So, we went. The hardware store people helped take care of that, I purchased drinks at the Dollar tree, we went around town for a few more of her errands, and made our way back home. Now I’m here again, making some changes from what I learned along the way. I realized that I need a clean uniform for work, so I just did a load of laundry and washed a few pairs of shoes. There are still a small few hours before work, so I’d like to hurry and be there early.

[Real] (6/1/25) Baby animals, and chill weekends
Weekend coming to a close a bit early.

We took off Friday and went to visit my parents. Took the princess to the Zoo I grew up going to. She had so much fun. Got to see Baby Tula (elephant im obsessed with), the 2 yr old orangutan was out and having so much fun. I didnt realize the Rhino had a baby until we where there. It was a lot of fun, and of course I got to see my favorite Stellar Sea Otters.

After the zoo my sister and I went over to the yarn store. I found some insanely soft yarn for a scarf to wear at hockey. So much of my hometown has changed. I can confidently say I would never move back there. Thats not home anymore.

Now we are almost home, laundry and dishes and adulting await us. Next weekend take us out to the fiber festival, and fluffy animals I can make friends with. Then a weekend of downtime and a long adventure across Oregon.

[real] (1/06/25) These days make me want to pause time
Lately, I’ve been feeling like I just want to pause time. It’s strange because for months I was so eager to leave this place. But now, when I’m around you, it feels like maybe it’s not so bad — maybe it’s even better, simply because you’re in it. I’m not sure how I feel about leaving anymore.

When I see you, everything seems lighter. My dreadful mornings don’t feel so heavy, and my lonely evenings turn into beautiful chaos. When I’m with you, I feel safe and protected. But I keep wondering — is all of this happening just because my days here are numbered? Or is it because I’d forgotten how it feels to be close to you?

Some people might think I’m struggling to move on, but the truth is, I don’t want to move on from you. Not because you’re perfect — you’re not. You’re probably not the best guy to date, but you’re definitely someone worth keeping in my life.

I’m scared of losing you when I leave. It’s something that keeps me up at night, even on nights when you’re lying next to me. Maybe I shouldn’t be so desperate to have all of you, because life rarely works out the way I hope. Still, deep down, I can’t help but wish for more memories with you. Memories I can hold onto and replay when you’re no longer close enough to feel.

[REAL] (06/01/25) Sundays... {God's Plan}
I had to pick out my "Sunday's Best". I wonder what you would think of my choices... something humble that speaks to my passion I think. I walk holly and then leave in an hour.

I have been reading scripture and am also buying an appocryphal Bible on audible. As well as some other spiritual texts... 

I'm already liking the church alot so far. There's a banquet and then fasting later today.  I do Bible study 2 times a week. 

My contracts will start soon; I will be picking up work soon. I can feel the pup getting excited for the road; we've both been able to gain Alot of weight. We are aready... 

Maybe the church will give me a stable foundation for what I do next...

It is strange how things just unfold in front of us.

The path revealed is kinda shocking/surprising...

First 13 chapter done; about to read them as well.

Audible is truly a blessing lol.

Enoch or more appocryphae on the list soon.

Today is going to be a good day.

[real] (1/06/2025) Mirrorball
It was a warm morning in June, the kind that smelled like endings and beginnings. The song Mirrorball by Taylor Swift played softly in the background while I got ready for one of the most important days of my entire life: high school graduation. But somehow, I couldn’t feel happy. Tears rolled down my face, and I quickly wiped them away, afraid of smudging my makeup—not for how I looked, but for what I was trying to hold together.

Before I can explain why that exciting day felt so overwhelming, I need to go back to the beginning, back to the little girl I once was.
For many years, I didn't see myself as particularly beautiful, nor did I feel like someone who stood out in a room.  I always used to tell myself, "If you can´t be pretty, at least you have to be good at doing something else"  In that way, I found safety in certainty, and certainty, for me, meant schoolwork".  I slowly adopted the role of "the smart one" -not because I wanted to be labeled, or because I truly believed in that statement, but because it felt like the only space I could truly be myself. "Hard working person" became my identity. My family started to notice that I was working twice as hard as anyone else they knew, missing familiar parties, not going to anyone's birthday, and quietly shaping myself as that relative that you know exists but rarely sees.
My family had a nickname for me "Carla Tarea", because I was always studying, always handing in assignments early, always carrying a pile of notebooks in my arms like armor. At the time, I laughed along with them. But deep inside, it hurt a little. Not because I was ashamed of who I was becoming, but because I wondered if anyone saw anything else. Slowly it became worse than ever. I was turning into a perfectionist, always trying to be perfect at everything, maintaining a perfect grade, going to piano lessons that I never enjoyed, learning music, French, and English, being in international STEM activities, being the class president, maintaining a ONG made by me, called “PsicoSalud”  and all at the same time. For me, it wasn't  a choice,  I must be loved by everyone and perfect at everything.

Politécnico Las Mercedes was not like other schools, it was one of the most prestigious institutions in my city. It wasn´t just different, it was more demanding and intense. The  pressure never ends. Stress and anxiety became a constant part of my daily life. I start to have panic attacks every day, all because of the feeling that I will never be enough. And so I continued like that for the last few years of my life, carrying the identity of the hardworking one, until I reached my senior year. The year that was supposed to be one of the best of my life, a year meant to be remembered forever.  

It all began on a calm June morning, as we awaited the announcement of the valedictorian. The principal approached me and my group of friends—each of them brilliant and exceptional. And at that moment, I felt proud. I was proud to be part of that group. The principal said:
-I need you guys to write down everything you did in school all those years”. We looked at each other and started to write. My friend María looked at me and said:
“I think you and I did a lot of things,” I said, because we both had to turn around our papers to write everything down.
A few days later, none of us had received any answer from the principal. So, my group of friends decided to chat about it all night.
“I think it's Kiara.”
“No, I think it 's María.”
“I think it’s Carla.”
There were a lot of options. But then, I calculated my GPA and realized it was a 98. I told my mom, excitedly:
“Mom, you won’t believe it! I got a 98 GPA!”
My mom looked at me sadly, as if she wasn’t proud of me. I hesitated and asked:
“What happened?”
She replied, softly:
“I’m sorry… you’re not the valedictorian.”
I was stunned. I just stood there, waiting for her to tell me it was a joke. Then, she opened her mouth again and said:
“Rosa is the valedictorian.”
Rosa is my cousin — like a sister to me. She was smart and charming, but she didn’t have the grades. I slowly walked to my room, lay on my bed, and cried myself to sleep. That mix of guilt, happiness for her, and sadness for me… it was overwhelming.

It was supposed to be a secret. My mom, Rosa, and my aunt were the only ones who knew. But soon, everyone would find out at the graduation ceremony.

Then my aunt called me and asked:
“Hey, how are you doing?”
I answered, trying to sound cheerful:
“Oh my God! I’m fine, and happy for Rosa — she deserved it.”

But deep down, I felt betrayed. I had given my school every tiny effort, every part of myself. We talked all night. I couldn’t hide my feelings from her — she knew me too well.
In the days that followed, I kept all my emotions inside. I appeared fine, and no one suspected anything.

Graduation day arrived. Everyone was ready and excited. I was about to skip it and throw everything away… but in the end, I gathered my strength and went to the ceremony. I had already given it my all — I owed it to myself to be there.
And there I was, sitting in the front row, just waiting for everything to end. Time felt painfully slow. Friends were talking, everyone was excited, waiting for that big moment — the one I had imagined over and over in my head.
Suddenly, the classmates sitting beside me started whispering.
“Carla,” Cristal said, “be prepared, they’re going to call you.”

I knew that wasn’t true, but I couldn’t tell her that I already knew the truth. Everyone — classmates, parents, friends, even the cameraman — began pointing their cameras at me. They all thought I was going to be the one.

Then, the principal revealed the name. The whole auditorium went silent in shock.
I stood up and clapped. Because the name they had called wasn’t mine — it was Rosa’s. My cousin. My sister. My best friend.

I had to support her, no matter what. She was the person I had loved most my whole life. We had shared countless moments together. We always understood each other so well. So why couldn’t I be happy for her?
She walked on stage and gave her speech. But I couldn’t hear a single word. I was there physically, but my mind was elsewhere, just waiting for it all to end.

When her mom came up to the stage, I felt proud — proud of them.
After the ceremony, it was time to take pictures. Rosa’s stepfather saw a tear on my face and said:
“Carla, stop already.”
Smiling brightly, I replied:
“It’s just that I’m so happy. I can’t help it.”
Rosa, who knows me better than anyone else, looked at me and said:
“This is for the both of us.”
But she didn’t understand. I wasn’t hurt because of a title or a trophy. It wasn’t about the recognition. It was about everything I had done — every sacrifice, every sleepless night, every ounce of effort.

That trophy wasn’t just a symbol of success. To me, it became a symbol of failure — of not being enough, despite having given everything I had.
Months and years went by, and I still felt like a failure in my parents’ lives. But deep down, I knew I had to keep moving forward. My mother supported me through everything, making things easier. Then, I realized something: maybe this was exactly what I needed. If it hadn’t happened, I might have stayed that insecure girl I used to be. Without a doubt, I am now grateful. I began to notice how my entire family had called me, filling me with their hopes and expectations. And when they learned I wasn’t the valedictorian, my aunt, my uncles, my cousins, and my grandparents still came to me — proud as ever.

But the moment I truly felt my effort was seen, was when my friend Nicaury — one of the people I admired most — came up to me and said she knew what had happened, and that she truly understood. At that moment, everything made sense. I was not a trophy. Everyone could see my effort — everyone except me. And right there, I started to understand: my accomplishments or failures don't define me as a person. What truly defined me was being kind, trustworthy, empathetic — and, above all, loving my family and friends more than anything else.
I started to grow as a person, and I no longer define myself by a grade or a certificate.
Now, I define myself by the way I make others feel, and the way I choose to love.

[Real] (05/31/2025) A Reminder of Desolation
I feel distracted and anxious. Grateful yet still yearning. I feel stranded but maybe some progress has been made. Ingenuine but present. These emotions are not exactly good. I had days when I was happier once the day has gone by. *Significantly happier.*

In the past few weeks, I always carry myself with a heavy heart as if a family member just died. But no, it is just my joy and hope rotting inside. How could people enjoy life and its ups and downs 'normally' despite knowing other people can't even deal with it? Of course, it is not their responsibility to make us feel better. We are all by ourselves to make the best out of this world. And maybe, I am just a *coward* and *insecure* to even make a first move of change.

Today, I met two of my closest friends. A meeting - initially a call for help from one of them to discuss her brief break-up from her boyfriend but eventually became a couple again after an hour - turns into my cry for help to finally tell them what has been going on. In the loud, cheery pub an hour away from my place is where I confessed. I cried less than what I hoped but I disclosed just like how I planned it. How lonely, isolating, painful I feel and more importantly, *jealous and envious* I am of others. How all I see are the good things I don't have. How blinded and hopeless my view of world is even if I rub it away as much and hard as I can. How all I can do now is succumb to the void I am in.

It is undeniable. All of these started again because of *him.* Not him, *him.* But what he symbolizes. What he signifies about my life. What he has that I don't have. What he provides. How he cares. How he thinks of and treats other people. *How someone can love and care and do all those things to someone...and how alien and foreign it is to me and that I may never experience it.* He reminds of that, yet it is not his fault but mine. It is all me. It is me who has problems. These are all my fault even as much as I want and hope it's not, but it is. The self-pity. The stagnation. The sins. It is me.

Kill me. That is just what I want. But maybe, not just now. I told the two of them I would try my best to collect myself again. Losing feels comfortable now but maybe I would stay a little bit longer. Only cuts and bruises will be here because that is what you get when facing battles. Few more weeks. Let us give chance to the future and let it be in our favor. For now, as I write, momentary rest will come in a few hours. Another day will come and maybe, just maybe, it would finally feel nice.

[real] (6/1/25)
It's crazy how a song can change the way you feel, physically, mentally, emotionally.

Just listening to the song "Time" is making me hopeful about what tomorrow and the next day will bring. 

I've also noticed that maybe a week without exercising and just resting isn't so bad. I actually feel a lot less heavy today than I do when I am intentionally exercising.

I have a Soulcycle class in the afternoon tomorrow. It will be nice to get back on track. 

I am kind of mad at myself for spending too much money last night on drinks at the masquerade ball. I had so much fun though and I think B really enjoyed it too. 

I'm off IG again. It was getting too overwhelming and I found myself wasting a lot of precious time.

[real] (31/05/25) do hell with adulting
I don’t know why people keep saying, “Welcome to adulting” — as if it’s something that just started. Honestly, I’ve been adulting long before anyone even called it that. It’s not like things were any easier back then. When I was younger, I thought about being an adult all the time, but never like this.

Back then, we imagined adulthood would be all about freedom and fun, not endless lists of flaws and responsibilities. Now, I see my flaws so clearly, but it’s hard to remember the good parts. And planning for just one good day? It takes weeks of effort.

It’s frustrating — the commitment to work has completely overshadowed the commitment to simply be happy. Some days it feels like that’s all there is: work and a lingering emptiness.

And of course, there’s always someone ready to say, “Stop whining, you’re an adult now.” As if that makes it any easier. Gosh. Now, you bloody take that away from me too.

[REAL] (05/30/2025) Trying Not to Leave First
&gt;"Wanna be happy. Could you show me how it’s done?" – Tom Odell

Okay, here's the thing... I'm kind of spiraling over Luisito. HAHAHAHAAHAHA. What’s new right? Honestly, I don't even know if I should respond to our letter—his response, the one that was 16k word long.

Okay, you know what? I will respond to this letter and try to have it sent on or before the weekend. Well, it's technically Friday so the weekend it is. I'm planning on working on this letter maybe throughout the night since I've got a really fucked up sleep anyway.

The reason I'm spiraling... this week, I pulled away from our conversations. The thing is, he didn't even give me any reason to pull away. It's just my stupid anxious avoidant attachment style. I don't even know if that's what you call it. Like really, when I'm having a little too much fun with someone, my mind just screams "Oh shit, nope nope nope. You're having way too much fun. Let's ruin this. Let's sabotage this. They're going to leave you anyway." And that's what I did. He was very engaging and consistent. Nothing changed on his end.

But I just pulled away because yeah... I was having too much fun with him. On top of that, I don't know. I was also already slipping in and out of exhaustion. Probably because of a lot of things—as always. I was getting tired from the conversations with my friend Jean which is a story for another time. Catching up with her was just exhausting. Let's just say she's the type of friend who can't seem to get out of her pattern. Which in turn you know, makes me think of myself. Because fucking hell, I can't get out of my pattern too.

Then there's the constant one about me being unemployed and the universe is not just whispering but is shoving me to start looking for a job now. And I get that. I truly do. I do want to start looking for a job, and really focus on it and really locked in on it. But the fear is stronger. I don't know.

Then there's the messed up sleeping schedule. A sleeping schedule I can't seem to fix, which I then realized that it's messed up because I'm basically functioning in Michigan time instead of Philippine time... because you know? Luisito is in Michigan.

Hahahahaha all this. Now I'm spiraling over Luisito because like I said, in this week, we were talking over the weekend carried over to Monday, and I just pulled away for 2 days. I know he's a very understanding guy but this friendship is too new. It has only been a month. More than a month. And it's so easy to lose new relationships you know?

Like I wanna talk to him again but what am I going to tell him? So right now, I'm basically just waiting for him to respond to the last letter I sent, the last letter I responded to. (This 16k word letter from him, this is our first and main letter since we started talking. We kind of have multiple letters going on depending on how much our "casual conversations" turn into long-ass letters).

I don't know. I hate this. I always do this to myself. And now I'm rambling. I'm still gonna do the letter, this 16k letter we call our "little book." But I don't know. I'm overthinking. I'm spiraling.

And of course, when I’m spiraling over everything, I do this grounding journals. I don’t know if it helps. Nothing can replace a real therapist blah blah blah. Just getting prompts and bouncing off ideas with an AI isn’t the real thing. I don’t know. Fuck it. I guess in a way it helps, you know? I like how sometimes the patterns and algorithms of this tool is kind of rubbing on me. Again, I don’t know. I’m going on a tangent here.

Anyway. On the grounding journal, the AI tool said something and I like that. It said:

&gt;And if your brain keeps yelling, “They’ll leave you anyway,” remind it: "Maybe. But this time, I'm not going to leave first."

Because honestly, I feel like I am truly the one leaving first. And I just pretend that it's them but the truth is, I've just been slowly sabotaging the relationship. And that’s on both platonic and romantic.

Ugh. How do I keep myself from doing this? I was singing this song earlier by Tom Odell. "Black Friday" I think the title was. The part: "I wanna be happy. Could you show me how it's done?"

Sighs. I really gotta hammer all these things Sage said to my brain. Like "stay." Or I deserve to be happy. I am allowed to be happy even if it's unfamiliar. I am allowed to be loved, even if it's new. I don't always have to run. Accept the love that comes my way.

One last sharing probably... yesterday, I sent my response to Luisito's letter. And after that, he acknowledged it as he always does. We don't usually respond right away to the letters because of course, they're long. So this was our short exchange:

LUISITO: Hola X, thank you for responding, always grateful for your time and space. And no need to apologize, exhaustion happens. I hope you’re doing well and everything is ok on your end. Cuídate, sending you much love.

ME: Heeey. I really appreciate your kindness and understanding, always. No pressure on anything just wanted to say it means a lot. I’m taking things slow right now, grounding myself. Hope you're taking care too. Besos y abrazos

LUISITO: I understand no worries, and that’s good, it’s always important to do that. Know that it means a lot to me too 🙂. Taking it day by day here, all is ok. Besos y abrazos para ti tambien

And after that, I didn't respond anymore. Because I was just spiraling, you know? I was reading a little too much between the lines when there's probably nothing for me to read between the lines. I'm just hella spiraling. But yeah...

I want to reach out but I feel like I shouldn't. I feel like I should just wait for him to respond to our last mini-letter. Then on the weekends, I'll try to send in my response to our little book, if I could finish responding to it.

Anyway, the grounding journal always helps. It calms me. It’s cathartic. And I guess, it ever so slightly shifts my mindset. So yeah, this is it for now. I’ll start responding to the 16k word letter Luisito sent me. And maybe write in some more about some of my other thoughts—nothing too deep. Just some benign existence.

It’s hard to think that dad died 9 years ago today. Even though he’s not dead, it hurts that I lost my step dad too. I can’t tell if dad would gloat about that. I think I’m the only one who misses him. For a former daddy’s girl, I don’t have a great track record with them. The weather ruined my hiking plans. In lieu, I drove up to lookout mountain for sunset, looked at old pictures, listened to our songs, and drove home late with his ashes in my cup holder. 

I wanted to be held or just needed a long hug. None of the friend’s I’ve made here felt right to ask. I wanted to ask my ex so badly and fought it. I’m still so confused about us and I don’t want to hurt him. I’m hurting a lot inside. Booked a massage yesterday to try to fill some of that need. It’s hard to spend that much money on myself, so it was my first one. The craniosacral holds were unnerving. Otherwise, it was great. Felt a bit drunk afterwards. My voice was deeper after. I was surprised the emotional release that came from it. Not for the tears themselves, more so the subject. 

At 3:30 am, I sobbed about gram’s death. I can’t tell if this medication is making me dream or have nightmares more. I dreamt I was watching the dementia take her again. She was mean, again. I know it’s the disease impairing your frontal lobe yet it still hurts. I expected to cry about dad. Mourning her was a long process before death took her, you know? Dying meant she was no longer suffering terrified moments of lucidity. 

I thought there were no tears left in me and writing this opened the floodgates. I’m stumbling here. I should make a therapy appointment again. So much is swirling, it’s a lot to carry. I miss you, dad.

[real] (5/30/25)
I guess the reason I'm back here is to see if journaling is actually helpful for my anxiety. I must admit that shutting my brain off for the past week has been nice, though it has made me reactivate IG and even made me forget about my therapy session last Friday. I think the last time I completely missed something was back in 2015 when I didn't know I had a meeting at work. I desperately want to spend the session telling M how guilty I feel, but I think she would prefer that I let myself off easy and not stress so hard. 

I've fallen off the exercise regimen but I'm hoping to get back into it again after this week. I'm going to a masquerade ball tomorrow night as B's date and I don't even know if I can fit into the beautiful ball gown I thrifted. 

I don't have much to say right now and I've been enjoying not having to overthink or over analyze things.

[real] (05/29/2025)
I slept so much today. When I woke up, I had a headache. I ate some “Chinese” take out, fruit, and drank juice/water. Then I continued watching videos from people I’ve subscribed to. 

At some point, I started to organize and spot clean, the house. Then my girlfriend called to connect with me. We made plans and then I continued with YouTube and cleaning. I washed my clothes. At some point, I started getting ready for a workout. By this time, it was her lunch, so she called and we sat down together. She ate while we talked. 

Afterwards, I started my workout, with plans to leave home around 6:45pm in order to stop at the local water store for a refill of drinking water, for my gallon. In the course, I received a call from my work. They wanted me to come in about three hours earlier. This would interfere with the plans that I made with my girlfriend, however, I’ve decided to trust the process and hoped this would be an opportunity to exercise my faith as well. Now I’m here at work, using my downtime to digest incoming messages and to take a moment to write in my journal. 

I will be at Taco Bell, working until 2am. I will make it through if I keep taking it, one step at a time. Good night!

[real] (05/29/2025)
I am so painfully alone. I’m 28 without friends (outside of work). I hear all the time how great I am, how fun I am to be around, this and that- but those niceties don’t extend beyond the obligations they’re being presented in. I don’t have people texting or calling outside of work things, asking me to come over or having people drop into my house unannounced (a normal thing where I live). I live alone. I’m single. I have no children. My longest relationship ended three years ago now and I haven’t had friend or dates or even a painfully stupid situation ship in that time. It was wonderful for the first year, tiresome in the second, and now it’s truly becoming unbearable. I feel like I’m past the age of being able to start a family, past the age of being stupid and fun. I just feel old in my life. I’m not at all old though, but the mundane existence I’ve found myself in hurts but I don’t know what to do about it either. Part of my issue is where I live but I also love where I live and love my job(s). I don’t want to go anywhere else or try starting again somewhere bigger. 

I’m frustrated in myself for the position I’ve put me into. It’s my fault for this, choosing the woods over the city. I’m frustrated being alone. I feel so insanely ugly and unloveable because I’ve not even been shown a lick of interest from other people (romantically) and the friendliness seems so fake when it ends abruptly when I clock out of work. I’m  also insanely jealous at some people in my life (both friends and people I don’t really like but have to see regularly). People who find new connections in the middle of their last ones while I can’t even begin to make the first. I’ve been cheated on and lied to, used, one date only situations. It just makes me feel horrible. Like I’m not worth the time to get to know deeper and more personally. Then I overthink every little tiny thing I do, recounting and reflecting to the point where it’s probably not healthy anymore. I’m deeply, excruciatingly aware of my flaws and work so hard on myself every day. I try to be a better version of myself than the day before, but it just goes unnoticed. And then I feel like such an attention seeker for crying about it when I get home. 

I also know it’s such a weird thing to complain about. That all these people surrounding my existence seem happy to see me around and this and that, but again it just never amounts to anything past kind words. I just want someone to find time for me. I know life is overwhelming and busy and too much is happening for everyone but I do actively go out of my way for others. I actively try and reach out, try and set things up with others. Even when I’m busy I make time for people, I listen fully and try my best to show that. I remember small details of people, I bring up things they tell me in passing. I do my best. I try so hard. Why can’t someone just try for me too? Why can’t I get the return of my efforts? I get home from work and do…nothing. Sometimes I’ll go out but there isn’t much around (or at least open late). I want to be thought of, remembered. I want love and kindness the way I give it to other people. And then I feel so selfish for 1. Thinking that I put effort in, and 2. For not recognizing what I have. But I genuinely do for both and I think that’s why it’s so grating. I feel selfish and stupid for comparing myself too but it’s just hard not to. It’s hard not to think I’m an absolutely horrible person that everyone is just lying to. 

I’m not looking for advice it’s just getting too heavy to hold onto these (admittedly hypocritical) issues I’ve found myself in. I’m sad and don’t have anywhere to dump this. There’s so much more I need to work on, I know that, but I feel like I deserve a little bit of return for what I’ve done to this point. I just want recognition and reminder from people who know me. I feel selfish and lonely and guilty. It’s hard to find a reason to keep going and keep trying and keep working on myself when none of it gets seen anyway. Life is so hard and I’m so alone in it all.

[REAL] (5/29/2025): "Crematorium" (Dark) (POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING) 🥀 {Ink Rose}
🥀 **V/XXIX/MMXXV**

Diary,

Without ground, ashes plume amongst this choking breath. Oxygen, privy.

Hold on! There are still pieces you seemed to have missed.

My toes, my wrists, my eyes, an empty vessel does not eliminate the ashed heart drifting beyond my grasp.

Does the curling of your smile rise when isolation burns without pain? Does the numb void taste of licorice, stringing more and more until you’ve recovered your insanity?

Is the hype villain to secure titles hidden beyond closet doors?

Every screech, every claw, the sound of freedom to your creep.

Holding knives above the light to ensure fear is not brave. Endure placement to dirt you promised was refined. Holding each metal wall, holding every tear begging darkness to take me, without fright, without scream, he desires to breed.

No exit. No tether. Only teeth. A scrumptious meal made of me.

A bite, don’t scream. A bruise, don’t bleed. A cower, don’t cry on your knees.

Do not spare forgiveness for the unseen. Shout only if certainty grabs your throat begging to be pleased.

*“Honor me, bitch! You scavenging whore, you worthless pore stuck amongst my perfect galore. You I want scattered in pieces like never before, save each limb for blood and gore, cook you tiny, within tiny spores, so to never lose my musing whore. Burn in the crematorium, you pieces chore. Hahaha, look at you tremble!"*

*"Oh dear, you know I love you so."* 

*"Now shut the fuck up before I claim you stamped for the boar. Raise your voice. Hahaha! No one cares. No one hears. Stupid you are. Stupid you remain. Look here now. Look, this dame, laugh a joy she suffers. Boohoo, boohoo, vicious life proclamation."*

*"Take a tooth, take her frame, she is a whore. Do not worry, young bae, she is pretend, your porcelain trend. Listen, hear, listen not. Let us make this annoying trot, **dissipate!** Is this not great! Hahaha... Hahaha... Hahaha...”*

Withered knee, pray for trust. Withered wall, grace me love. Withered soul, pray I’ll be lifted above.

Perfect view outside cremation. A joy unknown. A smile unheard. Perhaps now I’ll escape this place, this place called home.

Chained and forbidden. Run, beautiful soul, run, with many puppies tethered to your own. Cheer for death only when the sun severs. Cry not wolf. Breach clever. Fight in settle. Call for thunderstorms, they will help shelter.

Within, without, climb these wounds. Alternate hell. Grace of heaven, reach my toe, the one that has not been within Crematorium.

Be it continued evermore...

Burning savage. Salvaged. Bloody caveat. Ace galore, the whore...

**Your Ink Rose** 🥀

[real] (29/05/25) I never thought


I never thought I’d be this affected just by seeing that my ex–best friend viewed my farewell story. We used to be inseparable—*the* best of friends. And I think it’s true when they say no heartbreak quite compares to losing your best friend—not just in presence, but emotionally too.

I loved her more deeply than anyone could ever understand. Maybe even more than she ever knew. But somewhere along the way, things fell apart. We drifted so far that no effort could bring us back to what we once were. I tried—I reached out multiple times. But she didn’t feel the same anymore.

The girls who once screamed together, *“Does it ever drive you crazy just how fast the night changes?”*—we’ve now become a memory. A nostalgia that stings more than it soothes.

And yet, when I saw her name pop up under my farewell story after nearly a year and a half, I froze. This was the farewell I used to dream of sharing with her—showing her my outfit, my jewelry, laughing and reminiscing about how far we’d come. And now it’s come and gone… and all she did was view it. No message. No congratulations. Just silence.

But why, then, did a part of me ache for her all over again? It’s not like I haven’t survived without her. I have—I’ve made it through some of the hardest times in these last two years without her by my side. But still... I miss her. I miss my best friend.

Maybe it’s foolish, but I still wish things could be right again.
Please, God… I want her back. I need her. I love her.

There is nothing good about me. There is nothing beautiful about my outside or my inside. I am a waste of space and a drain on everyone around me. If I had gotten to where I am now ten years ago I might be a decent person right now, but I was too stupid to figure it out and now every day is a living hell. 

P.S. is nobody going to say anything about this subreddit’s avatar and wallpaper being changed to MS Paint drawings of dicks?

[Real] (4/28/25) Windows down, Raybans on.
I love this season. Its time for my shades, for the AC to finally kick on, popsicles in the hammock while my kid plays outside.

My first day solo at work was hell. But I survived, came home and immediately took my kiddo outside to play while I work on a project I've been neglecting for 5 months. It was so nice. Chill on my hammock, hat on to keep the sun out of my face, while happy squeals come from the slide.

Today went much better. The random text message "I love you bear" definitely helped. Especially when it was followed up with "date day for lunch?" I missed lunch dates so much. It was so nice to get out and just enjoy a meal together.
together. We've both had a lot going on but we've fallen into a routine in the evenings after princess goes to bed. We hang in our corners, watching whoever on YouTube is catching our attention, and then the last like 45 minutes of the evening I stop my crafting and get to cuddle on the couch with him.

Im happy, he's happy, princess is happy. Thats what matters.

[real] (28/05/2025) He’s the Perfect Boyfriend. But I Don’t Think I Belong in His World
Hey all it's me monica. 

I don’t know how to word this. But I feel like my boyfriend is too good to be real. And it’s messing me up. Like… actually messing me up.

We’ve been together for almost two years. And even now it feels new. Not in a boring way. But in a way where I still can’t believe this is my life. That he is in my life.

Before him, I had convinced myself I was doing fine. I was getting through life telling myself that I love computer science. That I’m just not good at it yet. That I’m being ungrateful when I feel like I’m drowning, because hey, I have everything, right?

And then he came along.

He ruined everything.

He made me realise I don’t have to be the best for someone to stay. That someone can still love and support me even when I’m lost. Even when I’m scared. That maybe I’m not as unlovable as I thought. That maybe I’m likable. That maybe I deserve to feel seen.

People have called me beautiful before. But he made me feel beautiful. In that soul-deep, warm kind of way. And he’s so beautiful himself. Like… unfairly beautiful. The kind of beautiful that hurts to look at sometimes. And somehow, he became my type. His hair, his laugh, his thoughts, his stupid little habits… my favourite everything. My favourite colour is whatever he’s wearing that day. My favourite peace is wherever he’s sitting.

He made me question if this whole draining, exhausting cs thing is just not my path. That maybe I’m not a failure. Maybe I’ve just been pushing in the wrong direction.

And he did all this without ever making me feel bitter about my parents. He’s always respectful. Always calm. Always kind. Too kind.

And now I’m back with my family.

And he feels like a beautiful lie.

The kind of lie you wish was true. The kind that makes you cry when you wake up. Because now I’m back in my real life.

Where I get called fat at least once a day. Where no one calls me pretty. Where eating food turns into a crime scene. Where I’m either starving or being yelled at for wanting more. Where my own mother’s touch makes my skin crawl. Where crying means weakness. And weakness means shame.

This is my life.

Not holding hands in peace. Not being fed until I’m full. Not being loved without conditions. Not having someone tell me that maybe I’m enough, even when I feel like nothing. That’s not my life. That was him.

He made me soft again. He made me forget I had to be hard. He made me feel safe enough to argue. To fight playfully. To trust. He made me stand up for myself.

And somehow… that’s not good.

Because now I’m back in a place where softness is a threat. Where silence is safer. Where love feels like a luxury I can’t afford.

So yeah.

That’s the drama.

And the worst part is… I see someone pretty on the street and all I can think is… maybe if we ever have a son, he’d look as pretty as that. That’s how gone I am.

I’m literally incapable of finding anyone but him attractive in a romantic way.

And yet, I want to break up with him.

Because this world I had with him doesn’t feel real. And it’s too painful to go back to living without it.

[REAL] (5/28/2025): Simple Threads - I🥀{Ink Rose}
🥀 **V/XXVIII/MMXXV**

Diary,

I've come to find that I still love you, *Snowman*. Why you won't leave my mind...I do not know... It's what I'm supposed to do... Right? Forget...

I believed that you would be right. That what we had experienced was simply limerence. My heart breaks at the notion of that being true when it's like I'm defying my own heart from the truth.

It never was limerence, and whoever put that in your head, I'd like to give them my two cents.

Jude tells me you loved me, you just couldn't say it. He believed what you showed and how you gave was enough proof you were in love with me. He believes we had something rare and true. Which is why it was difficult for you to decipher what you felt as love. He believes you were led astray and that, due to the manner people hurt you and portrayed love as duty, you couldn't see the value of what we had.

Jude's a little cranky with the way things ended between us. He's a great friend, though, he knows.

I've forgiven you and understand why you had to go.

Every gloomy day without sun, I lay in my bed, I close my eyes and slowly place both my hands intertwined, imagining one was yours. It's incredible how much I feel you spiritually, like you're still tethered to me, like I'm still on your mind, lingering.

You've always made me feel beautiful, like I was the *Queen* you waited for your whole life, but then you ran away before our storms could collide. Maybe, just maybe, the sun would have risen that night... I guess I'll never know.

I always imagine us finally meeting and both looking to the ground, unable to speak, trembling from excitement like two Chihuahuas. In my heart, I know that if we lifted to meet our eyes, our hearts would explode from connection and desire. Our minds would not reign anymore. 

We'd be puppets as our souls strung us to dance with a force this world could never know. I'd love you forevermore. A kind of love that never falters. I've never worn rose colored glasses, I am simply the violet ray that never became designated.

If only you knew, if only you believed. I'd cure your wallow with the touch of my palm upon your face. I love you.

If only... you didn't see yourself as a disgrace, as undeserving, I'd still be there by your side.

I wouldn't chase you. I'd be right beside your spirit, cheering you on and giggling a whisper upon your cheek. I love you.

You're my snowman, my kink. I cannot help but feel the source of you. *"I love you"* is what always comes back inside of me.

With the love you gave me, it carries me to remember even my own husband. It's like the two of you understood each other, and in some way, I think he really liked you too.

You made him feel jealous in a way he hadn't before, but he was also thankful you were in my life. You made my heart flutter and dance where a smile never stopped enchanting me.

When you left, my heart left too.

My husband noticed (*he missed the version of me that I was with you*), and all he could do at that moment was tell me, *"Sorry... I'm sorry we both failed you."*

I took my hand and placed it on his cheek, soothing him with my thumb. His face expressing defeat, looking into his eyes, I begged him not to speak of himself that way, that his mind deserves to feel kindness and love, not hate, not regret. I insisted to my husband that your (*Snowman*) departure was the only and best choice you could make, meanwhile masking how deeply inside I was screaming as if someone was torturing me for the light in my soul.

I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't imagine a life without you. I kept masking for the sake of those surrounding me. I searched for weeks to see if you'd maybe left a message, always knowing if you did, I'd never know if it would be for me. You were private like that. 

Sometimes I wonder if you've driven around the city on a trip to my state, to see if maybe fate would lend you a hand to find me. But I know the strings that were left inside the hollow casing of my heart were just humming to me a second chance, to grace a new start.

A chance to at least meet your fragile heart. Listen to its beating, laying my head upon your chest as you embraced me like you'd never want to let go, holding tightly, gently kissing the top of my head. I'll never know.

You were always afraid of knowing what it would do to you if we met.

I hope, truly, sincerely, that never getting that chance brought you peace and that you are not suffering the way I do every day, knowing someone gets to say hi to you and the ghost of you still haunts me when the skies rain, clouds block the sun. Because, my *Snowman*, I know it's you. Maybe your heart never let go, but I truly hope you're not suffering too.

I'll always be the bubble you never climbed into,

**Your Ink Rose** 🥀

*I'll always remember you, sweet, divine, beautiful Snowman.*

[real] (28/05/25) I hate "love" so much
I had believed in "magical love" all my life. I mean not so recently i became a rom-com addict. I literally have an immense love for these rom-coms especially MOHABBATEIN movie. It has my heart!!!! I am kind of delusional for love. I've never been in love. Like never even got to experience it mistakenly. But I still believe that somewhere it exists in this materialistic world (probably). Though now it seems like i don't want to believe in it anymore.

My favourite youtuber thewizardliz got engaged and after an year not even an year she got cheated and she's 4 months pregnant! I mean because of these kinda men i hate the overall population of men (including the good ones). Like does cheating makes them cool? I am seriously sick of these men who make some of us hate "love" so damn much. 

I somehow now question it's existence. Liz who got cheated on i mean she's my inspiration. Even tho I'm still processing my self-care journey. When I used to listen to her videos it made me feel so strong. But I'm truly disappointed by the fact that "true love" doesn't really exists. It's all in the movies we watch and all in the k-dramas. I hate saying how much i DESPISE love .

[real] (27/05/25)
Yesterday was my farewell, and I genuinely can’t stop thinking about how beautiful I felt in my dark teal chiffon saree. Oh, and it rained—like it *really* rained—and for a moment, it felt like the winds themselves were wrapping around me, lifting my pallu in the air like I was living my own Bollywood dream. I felt confident, radiant, and entirely myself. Nothing and no one could’ve taken that feeling away from me.

But underneath that glow, there was fear too. These past two years have been hell, honestly. I’ve endured toxic work environments, lost people I truly cared about, and often felt like I was standing alone with no safety net. There hasn’t really been anyone I could fully lean on.

Even yesterday, I found myself clicking pictures with people in my class—some for the very first time. I can’t quite wrap my head around it. How do people go from not talking to you for two years to suddenly wanting memories together? Is that their way of saying you’re worth remembering, even if they never bothered to check in on you before? I know I might sound cynical, but it all feels a little shallow.

That said, the day *was* beautiful. I ended up going to an after-party and, surprisingly, had fun. Met some classmates outside the academic bubble for the first time—go figure.

Now, back to reality—final exams, submissions, and all that madness. God bless me.

[real] (05/27/25) And life moves on
We dated off and on for 7 years. You were 28 and I was 19 when we met. I was a fresh college student when you came through my lane at the grocery store that I worked at. I thought you were so handsome, charming. Six months went by and I finally saw you again, I nervously scribbled my number on the back of your receipt and told you:

"Your gonna want to keep that". 

You turned it over and saw my number, your eyebrows shot up in surprise. I didn't think you would text me. But you did. 

The first two weeks were insane. You seemed like an amazing "boyfriend". But then you quickly got distant. Over the years I felt like I had to fight for your attention and love. I loved you and wanted you to love me. Even when you cheated, lied, played with my emotions, and even when you didn't want to go to my father's funeral with me. You took pieces of me, little by little. And I am no better, because I let you do it. 

I always thought I'd go back to you. But every time I did, something would hurt me in some way. Eventually I just became numb, a shell of the independent woman I was. I knew you were never going to love me, move in with me despite my advances, marry me...

I eventually gave up. 

A year and a half ago you came back again, wanting us to work out. You had grown up and became mostly a better person but we were no good for each other. We brought out the worst in each other. 

You wanted to talk things through, so I met you at a coffee shop. Somewhere public because we always ended up having sex. It was the thing that bonded us. 

Somehow, dispite the numbness, you struck a chord while trying to talk about the past. I was crying and needed to leave because I hated crying in public. 

We went to my place. I was so emotionally drained so of course we defaulted to sex. 

After that you thought we were dating. But we had never actually defined that. And that became very apparent when we were hanging out a few weeks after that when some kid I was friends with was texting me. 

You got jealous, I told you I'm not interested in him or anyone, or dating in general. 

"But WE'RE dating.." you looked betrayed. 

I told you that we had never talked about that. 

And I saw you break. For the first time I saw you break down and cry. I comforted you the best I could. But afterwards when I was home, I couldn't help but feel like what just happened was manipulative. 

I finally texted you that I never wanted to see you again. I said some things that I had held in for years. I called you a narcissist. Mentioned every hurt, every piece you took. I was factual, but also cruel. 

And I moved on. 

And so did you. 

It's been a year and a half and out of nowhere I see you. You're dating someone now, she has kids and is a nurse like you. Your dad just died and for that I'm sorry. I know he was sick for so long. 

You live with her. And in the obituary it says "accepted grandchildren".... 

I remember you telling me how your family wouldn't approve of us living together after 4 years of dating. I remember you telling me that you didn't want kids... 

I don't want to be with you. But it still hurts. 

Even now, I wanted to send flowers for your father. But I won't. I don't believe in God, but I pray to some cosmic being that you get all the happiness in world that we were never allowed to have. I pray that you have a long happy life with good fortune, that you feel fulfilled in life, that you don't suffer too long with the loss of your father, that you get married and feel loved by your girlfriend, and that you get to be the best dad to her kids. And I pray to fucking God that you never know that I wish that for you, because I am your past. 

And life moves on.

[REAL] (5/27/2025): Gently Pulse Upon Evanescence 🥀{Ink Rose}
🥀 **V/XXVII/MMXXV**

Diary,

There is flare before mine eyes, where darkness has risen. What glimmers does sight desire, an unexpected guest? 

Lost deserted seas simply floating as waves pushed this body upon an island. The crescent moon shifting in theatrical, *Beethoven* himself pierres away upon sailing travels. Searching for an encompassing reason. 

Thy fair skin fallen upon sand of unknown waters. 

Tides warm, gentle as plush blankets, caressing a path to enchant me. Blue glimmers continued upon shells. Being jolted afar from candle light, a tear slipped upon my cheek. 

Forgetting not... yet does my own embrace embroid sealant upon my heart. What would be said knowing drifting waves pulled thy body unnamed. 

No longer these hands hold silver and gemstones.

Shivering, thy fair body laid before water in hope warmth would carry on. Only suddenly to find an eager hand cloaking thy shoulder. Trimming of exotic leaves shaded over wounds, shielding me as storming tides continued to reach the surface of my womb. 

Still darkness lingered, brown eyes grew heavy, despaired upon veils carried afar, shalt this only mend as night shatters upon abandonment. Blurred too quaint for quails of my hand, dare answer? Intruding, I lay upon another's beauty. A spillage of ink poured off me, looting tides of sparkling diamonds. As I held each breath prevailing above water. 

Shatter me not strange warmth upon thy broken heart, voice beaconing familiarity, overcomes, reasoning memory away from gaunt. Thy brown murky eyes strengthen upon will to confide  innocence fueled by disdain. Upon the rhythms of echo May, this heart knew too well. Surrender me not upon the hollow moon as I shrivel into disparity. 

Blurred vision does not erase fire that burns away shadows, though thine light was not coarse, its blue fumed of glimmers reflecting sparkle upon waves. Thine shining grace, shyer than a child blooming in night and day. 

Hallowill reverest, curious as a dead cat alive in shade. I will not segregate grace upon my darkest dredurgrby. 

Spill me yet upon drivel, and I will climate. Fear not of glory be. 

Conductor of glimmers, shy dream, my curiosity raises stream, guide ever gleam.

Without prosperity,  

**Your Ink Rose** 🥀

[real] (05/26/2025)
Today, me and four friends went on a trip. We visited the city of Solvang, the danish capital of America. From there, we stopped at an ostrich farm to feed the ostriches. We also stopped by the beach on the way. There were seals molting on the beach. Hearst Castle was nearby, so we stopped at the museum. It was situated on top of a hill and could be viewed from binoculars. We arrived late in the day, so tours were no longer being offered. We drove home and had in-n-out along the way. We got home pretty late. My rural town seemed more familiar than ever, after spending the day in a touristic danish town. We unpacked, showered, ate, and slept because some of us had work early in the morning.

[REAL] (05/28/2025) Maybe the Universe Group-Chatted Me
Today was strange in the most tender way.

Ancel messaged me out of nowhere. Just a “Heyy. How are you?” I wasn’t expecting it. I had thought of her a few times in the past few months—sent her a message about a month ago, just letting her know I was thinking of her, hoping she was okay. But that was it. Silence. And then today, her name popped up again.

Funny thing is, I messaged her once because I remembered something heavy she had shared with me. And in a way, I just wanted her to know that I remembered. That I cared. That I missed her, too.

Then not long after Ancel, Jenny messaged. Another familiar presence. We haven’t talked in a while either. Well, that’s on me—I don’t really reach out to her as much as I probably should. But she still messages me every now and then. Just randomly sharing stuff. And today, she also asked how I’ve been doing. She’s into politics, and I could tell that was partly what brought her back into the conversation. But still—she reached out.

And then came Luisito.

I made a stupid joke to the Universe earlier, thinking, “Well, if this is a pattern—if I really am in a dark place again and the Universe is sending me comfort—then maybe Luisito will show up, too.”

It was a joke. A dumb, desperate kind of hope. I’ve been the one pulling away. Luisito has always been consistent—my little constant these past few weeks. But I turned into this messed-up, clingy girl who just wanted her crush to miss her. I know. Stupid. And even worse, I’m 32. So… hella stupid.

But he did. He responded to one of the few “letters” we’ve exchanged.

One by one, the three people who’ve sat with me in my worst—my suicidal, drowning, aching versions—showed up. They didn’t try to fix me before—they just stayed. They let me be.

And I can’t lie… it scared me, seeing their names appear. Because I don’t know what to say. I don’t feel equipped to talk. I don’t know how to hold space for others when I barely have any left for myself. I’ve been pulling away, turning inward, staying small.

But still, something shifted.

It reminded me that maybe I do live in people’s minds—quietly and without knowing. Maybe I take up a tiny bit of rent-free space in someone’s memory. Maybe someone thinks of me when they hear a song, or smell something familiar, or remember a moment when I made them laugh or cry or feel safe. That’s kind of beautiful. And heartbreaking.

Because truthfully, I keep thinking about how often we never really know how deeply we’re loved. How many compliments go unsaid. How many tender thoughts pass through someone else’s mind without ever reaching our ears.

A stranger might look at you and think you’re beautiful.

A classmate might think of you as their favorite person.

A coworker might be staying in that shitty job just because you make it bearable.

Someone might be rooting for you, silently. And you’ll never know. That’s the tragedy and the magic of being human. We walk around not knowing the impact we’ve made.

And today, in this quiet flood of messages, I was reminded that maybe—just maybe—I’m more loved than I’ve allowed myself to believe. Sometimes, when you’re not asking for comfort but it shows up anyway, it means you’re loved more deeply than you thought.

Maybe I’m just overthinking.

If the three of them heard me say all this, they’d probably laugh and say, “You’re being dramatic. It was just a random message.” Which it might’ve been.

I might be assigning cosmic meaning to three people who, coincidentally, have brought me the most comfort and held the safest space for me.

But whatever.

I’d like to think this is the Universe trying to comfort me. It doesn’t mean I’m spiraling. It doesn’t mean I’m doomed. It might just mean the Universe is whispering, You don’t have to do this part alone.

Even if I don’t answer right away. Even if all I do is sit with the comfort for now.

That’s still enough.

[real] (5/27/25)
I know that something is wrong with me. I feel awful all the time. I know that there is actually something wrong. It’s not in my head, it’s not a story I’m telling myself, it’s not just a case of needing an “attitude adjustment.” There is actually something bad here. I feel it. I hurt. All the time. That’s not normal. That can’t be normal. 

I can’t handle one more instance of someone telling me “you seem fine.” 

Test results say you’re okay. You’re holding up well, there must not be anything wrong. It’s not as bad as you say it is. You’re not actually in pain. There’s nothing wrong with you. 

I know I’m sick. I can fucking feel it. You’re just not listening. Or you’re looking in the wrong place. Or you’re projecting what you know of the world and pretending that it’s the only possible interpretation. 

I. Am not. Okay. And if someone doesn’t listen soon, I won’t be around anymore to tell them for the millionth time that something is wrong.

[Real] (5/26/25) Peace and Progress
This has been a much needed chill weekend. I finished the wedding present blanket, it just needs to dry. I made progress on Princess Cupcakes blanket. I cleaned out my dresser and closet.

I found some new shorts that fit really well. I just got to relax. Today is laundry and general clean up. I'm excited to go to my moms this coming weekend and just be with my family.

I've really found some peace the last couple of days, more than before. That's what I needed. Between the early morning snuggles with my daughter to the snuggles at the end of the day with my husband, this is my happy - my peace.

Now if only I had more time to finish my crafts. I'm down to 4, princess cupcakes blanket, socks, a tea towel and another blanket.

If I'm lucky I can make my privet today too

[REAL] (5/26/2025): Once Upon A Phantom of My Opera 🥀 {Ink Rose}
🥀 **V/XXVI/MMXXV**

Diary,

The world upon my eyes paused infinitely as he placed his hand upon my own, *Thy Phantom Of My Opera*, polarizing, hypnotizing stolen steps as he swayed me away from crowded men. Fawning without tremble, only revere. He was grace without mystery, carrying secrets within the space underneath thy mask he held tightly from my embrace. Unknowledgeable of my own forsake, as the mask could not hide, what my heart maintained.

Come not hither, my *Phantom*. I bid thee not to shamble. Thou hast no fear within mine arms...

Thy dress unfolds gently as we waltz upon darkness, away from prying eyes. Our secret not unfounded, every glimmer, every rise kept close, in view of blush upon thy cheeks. Thy *Phantom* endured, keepeth my heart from frivolous pace. Jealousy crawling upon his graceful composure, thy love, thy chaste. Unfathomable was another's embrace, thee touch of fingers, lips engraved. Secretly bent of broken melody to enchant, madly intertwined by destain. His fluster, his frustrations grew to unbind.

Fierce as fire, he took me upon his hand, his lips gently carving into trembles, thy body ached, yearning, longing the exploration of his grace. Touching me intimately, like no other, without shame, without physical claim, without intention, thy souls upon us simply dancing as if cursed within, an alchemy naturally made from thy hand of God. Etched upon fallen stars within swirling galaxies.

He claimed my name, unmasking me without disgrace, craving my response to his plague. Gently his words and fingers stroked my cheek, swallowing sighs equally in defeat. His desire storming depths hell cannot procreate.

His fingers drifted down upon my skin beneath my chin, gently whispering upon my ache.

*"Take thy body, guild response, thou not end midnight, thou not let my trembles waste, thine resistance of such conflicted touch, tolerance imbalance upon hearts. Paced, galaxies sways as we control not skies nor moonlight. Control of thy heart isth not sustainable. Thy desire, thy unaffordable plight, laid, they would linger. Insatiable desire no longer held in contempt.*

*Name thy body as thy throne, claim my innocence as no longer trivial with end. Beg of you not fallen of thee fraught, carry thy flesh upon awaiting thy name claimed by fate. Without will I fall upon your tether, *Phantom Of My Opera*, claim me, claim thee, I am yours."*

He graced me with resistance, his hands unable to sustain a tremble, his touch so gentle, so soft. Hot breath traveling upon my neck, embraced by flushed, begging lips, unable to hold leashed fire blazing darkness, a light too bright to escape. Spells casted, unleashed upon ourselves. Skin of suede up and down my waist, whispering my name, a touch upon my bosom, a taste upon my grace. My breath could not dust a welted cry, my body yearning for thine evermore.

*'Forbid not of glory'*, his words whispered in gloom. His mind now of pleasures undefined, my sigh deepening without hush, his velvet tongue upon thy flower forsaken of touch, awakening velvet prophecies without tame. Wet embrace, his voice shakes, twirling sustain, as my back arches reframed. Breath heavy in shambles as dams unraveled, quenching an ever thirst. I beg of you, release me not. Hold your breath upon thy flower, let thy body be released of tears if which one defy unknowns of time and tide. Heavy moans shriveled, carrying on within his embrace, so cruel, yet enchantingly swoon.

Jolt wept thine eyes. Awaken thee!... Startled wane... 

A moment of pause carries me, for the *Phantom* is that of its own, a ghost no longer close, a perishable, a slit of thy wrists unplugged, unplanned.

Why had life left us with unmet choices, unfinished pages, a love story unannounced? Warm cup of Joe unexplored. Beach waves awaiting our pearls.

Memories fade from my mind, but not in my heart. Your presence, an entity wild without name, as you once laid upon my throne, one you claimed. My heart, my soul, willed dances remain unknown. Will you finally claim what has always been yours to own?

Forevers unknown, one I may never know. Patiently holding thy crown, left... unrefined. 

For thy *Phantom* who fled, the *Phantom* of my continued drought, unsustainable thread. An Opera heard through silence, unfairly wed.

Withering Rose, give me strength, truly, faithfully, always, devotional...


**Your Ink Rose** 🥀

[REAL] (05/26/2025) Okay, Universe. I get it!
Muriel messaged me today and sent her aunt’s contact info. A couple of nights ago, she and I kind of reconnected during a game night with my best friend. It’s honestly been forever since we last talked. The three of us—Muriel, my best friend, and I—used to be co-workers. Muriel and I weren’t super close; she was always closer with my best friend.

Anyway, like I said, we reconnected a bit while playing Left 4 Dead—a classic my best friend and I still go back to. After two campaigns, I told them I’d tap out. My social battery runs out fast, especially around people I’m not entirely comfortable with yet. Plus, it was a work night for them. They’re both on night shift, while I… well, I have a fucked up sleep schedule and apparently function on Eastern Daylight Time now, lol.

I reminded them about work, but they both said it would be a light day—probably because Memorial Day was coming up. We ended up staying in the game lobby for a while just chatting and catching up. We asked Muriel about her job and all that. It was simple, light catching-up. At one point, Muriel asked if we’d consider going back to the company we all used to work for. I couldn’t tell if she was joking or not, but we all agreed—our old company was chaotic as hell.

And here I am. It’s been a long while since I last worked. I can’t even say I’m “in between jobs,” because let’s be real—I haven’t really been looking. It’s been nearly two years of unemployment. That’s shitty at this age. And like the true spoiled brat I am, I’ve been leeching off my parents’ wealth—well, kind of. But that’s another story. One I probably need to actually sit with and write properly one day.

Anyway. Fuck. I’m rambling.

The point of this journal is—I think this is the universe nudging me. Muriel showing up again, then offering a possible connection, feels like a sign. A real one. A reminder that I’ve been floating through an unstructured life for far too long. This time, the universe isn’t just whispering—it’s shoving.

Muriel’s aunt works for a sister company of our old workplace. She said I could try reaching out to her aunt, maybe get some help getting in. And… ya veremos. But I know it’s a sign. A wake-up call. A reminder that I need to actually start doing something instead of this half-hearted pretending I’ve been calling “productivity.” I love writing my heart out, but it’s not enough if I’m not moving forward.

Sighs. Like I said, I’ll save the “spoiled brat leeching off her parents” piece for another day. Right now, I need to stop being so fucking depressed and do something. Get back to that mantra that helped me crawl out of my 2024 rut: If not me, then who?

I don’t know. I really don’t.

Fuck—I’m just so scared. So fucking scared. The urge to disappear is getting strong again, but like always, I don’t actually do anything about it. And I won’t get graphic here, but you know what I always say: my cowardice is the only reason I’m still here. So if I can’t even follow through with leaving, I might as well start building a life that feels worth staying for, right?

Who knows? Who fucking knows. Maybe—even at this age—I’ll end up in Oregon. Or Spain. Or some place that isn’t here. Some place that isn’t this same goddamn room I’ve been cooped up in for too long.

[REAL] (5/25/2025): Sanctum of the Withering Rose {Ink Rose}
🥀 **V/XXV/MMXXV**

Diary,

The quality of which disaster to choose only emplifies in quarrels. No longer holding the pen to rewrite the untold. What path do these expectations hurl into impediment? Forsaken me not, forsaken me yet, carving into my soul as the bringer to tie and strip naked at the sentencing of deniers.

Deceived without shameless contract. Why hold me as a pig above fire, roasted alive in the name of self perversed charities?

Hindering again at a pace of 500 hours a day, senseless sensibility. Claim me light, for the traction no longer crates these weathered tears. Congregate to sashes, blending hate with melody. Desire is no longer a linger of my essential fate. This plate must be changed to golded plated, as my harsnessed arms break free from fabrication.

No longer will my ears bleed rhythms that do not formulate grace in my name. Redemption, I beg of you, reclaim his name, bring grace to the slow death he maimed. Bleed the river of death into regeneration, unchasted hemmed blades, force stronger than cheap champagne. Thy foolish graze will not fondle. Will facades, do not fear its shame, bringer of death holds change.

No longer, no way. Prevalence.

Flames of rage are lit, ashes for your ark of pain. Scare past, as for movement is the new character eloped in my veins.

Uncharted Rein coined rage, for never knows, peaks.

Charged Riseth,

**Your Ink Rose** 🥀

[real] (05/25/2025) gators are my allies

Man... this whole week's been a fucking rollercoaster. I think I'm just gonna write it all down. It's a chill Sunday morning and I'm enjoying a nice tiropita and a fredo espresso right now, so this is a good a time as any.

Last Saturday was my big party. I'd been planning it for a long time and I'd invited all my friends from different friend groups. We watched Eurovision together and we had a blast, it was legit so much fun!! I mean, apart from the events that transpired during the contest itself... But I was so happy to experience it with all my friends there :)

There were two people from out of town, and they stayed the night at my place. They are friends from my high school, so I've known them for like 15 years, they are my ride or die. One week ago I would have told you I would walk through fire for them, no questions asked... But this is also where things start to get weird. 

So one of them, I've noticed a sort of change in him over the past year or so. He used to be kind of more in the background, like when we get together with our friend group he used to make jokes and stuff, but in more serious conversations he would never really engage that much. So I considered him my friend, but we were never really that close or anything. Then last year he seemingly started to change. He started being more actively present, being more supportive when one of us was going through some hard times, more empathetic in a way, I guess. 

So that's one thing. Then on the other hand, I noticed that he started trying to get closer to me, I think? Like he made me a playlist on Spotify, he started making more "teasing" style jokes with me, he'd always tell me that he wants to come over to my city, and when he hugged me (everyone always hugs everyone in our friend group so that was normal) I noticed he started hugging me a little bit tighter. But moments like those would always be interspaced with months of not hearing from him at all. Like I said, it was kinda weird.

So like I mentioned in my previous post, I love receiving attention way too much, and I started developing some sort of feelings for him. But at the same time I was kinda sus, and I ws waiting to see what he would do. Then last Saturday comes round, we have a good time, he and one other friend stay over. We end up talking until 4 AM, it was really nice, it reminded me of the sleepovers we had way back when we were kids. 

We ended up talking about our lives, about our deep and honest feelings, and during those conversations I was reminded of the  [bullshit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiaryOfARedditor/s/JVc0oLBeCq) (i.e. the traumatic event that uprooted my life and I'm still in therapy for now) that happened to me two years ago. I had never told them about it, but now seemed like the right time. And it felt like a good thing to do for my healing process, bc I trust these people with my life.

So I told them about it... and they kinda went quiet. Which is not abnormal, I think. It can be quite shocking to hear, and there's a big stigma around it in our society, so nobody really knows how to deal with it. But they were like, really quiet. I was just sitting there kind of awkwardly, like "so... Idk, do you have any questions?" Then I noticed than one of them (the not weird one) had tears in his eyes. He was just weeping, very silently. He was crying for me. So we cried together, and hugged it out. It was actually quite wholesome.

The other guy though.. he made it weird. He just sat there, not saying anything, until after like 5 minutes of silence he could muster something. Can you guess the first thing this fucker said? He was like "Um, yeah so I guess you haven't dated anyone since then, huh?" 

First of all, what in the fucking fuck? How is that the first thing that comes to your fucking mind? Just in general, in any given situation. Even if some random person that you met 5 minutes ago and you will never see again tells you this happened to them, that is not an acceptable response. But I'm not some random person now, am I? You've been my supposed friend for 15 god damn years, and *that's* all you can think about? Needless to say, I'm hurt, deeply, fuck.

Yeah it sucks, man. I really thought this guy would be different, but he clearly isn't. Fucking mental maturity of a 14 year old. And what sucks the most is that now, in my mind, he gets sorted onto the "men being assholes" pile. My friend that I've know for 15 years. Well, guess I never really knew him at all. 

Wanna know a fun fact about crocodilians? Their stomachs are so acidic that it dissolves every part of their prey, even the hair, even the bones. A whole body could disappear in one end and come out a perfectly unrecognizable pile of shit the other end. 

When I close my eyes, I see the swamps in my mind. Miles and miles of them. Full of wildlife. Vulture, patiently circling round in the skies. And behind every tree, in every little pond, alligators are lurking, waiting for their next prey. All I gotta do is sit back and wait for the bodies to be dissolved.

____________

Edit bc I'm not fucking done writing. Ive got so much fucking shit on my mind. This whole week has been a rollercoaster.

Yesterday was my friend's wedding. Just the civil part, they will have a bigger one with a big party later. This time it was just her parents (not the grooms parents bc they live on the other side of the world) and apparently, me. I say apparently, bc she forgot to actually invite me. I just came to her place to help her get ready, and then at some point she was like "oh yeah you should probably come with us to the location.

So I came with them. It was honestly beautiful. They looked amazing, both of them. The ceremony itself was like 10 minutes, and after that it was a couple hours of photoshoot. Outside. While it was pouring with rain. I was there, constantly running around, helping to carry equipment, keeping her dress as clean as possible, getting things ready for the next photo. I didn't have a coat or an umbrella or anything, I was just getting soaked out there. And I did all of it with love. 

After that, we went back to their place. I helped clean the house and set things up for the guests coming over for a drink. It was a small party, and it was nice. But the other people from our friend group came over and the thing is, when we all get together, I never feel like I fit in. Anything I say always gets ignored, activities I suggest always get dismissed, when I put a song in the queue it always gets skipped, stuff like that. I'm never treated like a fucking human bei who's worth acknowledging. And normally this one friend is there to balance it out, but this time she was almost physically stuck to the groom. Which is fair, and I don't blame them, but I was then left with these people that treat me like shit. And I felt under so much pressure to keep up appearances, I really didn't wanna cause any drama, but I was fucking exhausted, I had barely eaten anything all day, and at the same time trying to work through the emotions of the rest of the week. 

So I stepped out. I took the fucking umbrella, the one that they'd used earlier that day in the wedding photoshoot while I was getting drenched. I went for a walk in the park, through the mud in the pouring rain, in my fucking reception dress and high heels, weeping. I was so over it.

I'm kinda over them. I try so hard in everything I do. I try to make everyone feel included, feel supported, feel like they are enough. I wish I would just for once get any sort of appreciation back for it. But I'm not gonna get it from these people. If I try to be myself, I just get dismissed. So I bend over backwards trying to change and fit in with them., and for what? 

So yeah, I'm done with that.

[real] (25/05/2025) secret bathroom diary
hey reddit.

i’ve recently gone through a breakup, a bit of depression, and the classic “i’m 30 wtf am i doing with my life” kind of crisis. and weirdly enough, the way i’m trying to get my life back together is… through bathroom photos.

because of my job, i travel more than most people, and i’ve always been kinda obsessed with bathrooms. for years i’ve had this idea in the back of my mind to collect and post them, and i finally started doing it. i’ve been organizing the photos and writing down the random thoughts i had while taking them. but... idk if i should continue this project because i don't really have any followers and sometimes i fell like what i am doing is in vain.

anyway, if you want to see my secret diary, my insta is ipee.alot :)

[REAL] (5/25/2025): Imperfectly Raw {Ink Rose}
🥀 **V/XXV/MMXXV**

Diary,

I think about my life and imagine how other people’s stories must be similar but different. No matter if I fit in, I always seemed to become an outcast. My friends trusted me enough to offer them advice or to release secrets. That would not last long when they distrusted me as others lies and claims, dirtied my name. Seeing me as lacking what they desired me to be. It seemed the world sought me as a possession, a foe, instead of a friend. 

I still wait to see if someone holds the ability to see me as I am, human. If they'd love me with all my flaws, accept me, choose to stay beside me, not out of duty or because they feel lonely or lost. But because they'd like to have a friend they can talk to or run into every other year, month, day, whatever length they feel. Not to hold company but simply because we exist carrying our presence with heart.

Time, distance, even paused conversations or unattended words would not push me astray. The world is busy, I simply enjoy that moment to say, *"hey".* Thinking, your alive old chap, *"Hows the mundane?"*

I met someone like that, but he had to go as fate did not allow our stay. As I know, even right now, he probably thinks of me, even if it’s just crumbs. I know he wishes it could be the whole bagel. Maybe if fate allows, we will get to meet and eat a chunk. 

He told me, *“To me, it’s never goodbye. For me, it’s like we never had gone apart."* My heart warms at the thought of knowing somewhere out there my memory is valued.

There is times when I feel frustrated and unstable, I know it’s my inner child pouting from the lack of love and attention she longed to receive long ago. Aching lost love from a father who carried too much depreciation and pride to sustain my childhood butterfly kisses that I know he misses. It carries me with a heavy weight leaving me challenged with uncertainty of my desire to bring it back to life. In spirit my father abandoned our bond at an early stage of my life. 

Sometimes I wonder if perhaps that is why love for me never truly is sustained or stays. I wonder sometimes if my anger and frustrations are that of an immature child who has difficulty not wanting to cultivate a perfect social environment, which my mother disciplined into me at an early. I was never the *perfect daughter*, just the disappointment and the rebellion. In reality, I was emotionally intelligent at a young age and felt really lonely, unseen, and devalued.

It wasn’t like many say, that a parent must play with you or be a certain way not to affect a child’s emotional state, because they aren’t physically present, no. It was because my mother denied me a voice. Not by being tough and strict about what she felt was necessary for me to learn, no. I value my mother’s strength. 

It was her judgment of me, her will to perfect my image, to be cruel if I wasn't the idea created in her head. Her persistence to invalidate my truth, her distrust in me when I was simply trying to communicate the truth. That is what caused my spirit to dim.

I married a man with a full volume of these same qualities. He was not always like this, but I still feel a fool to believe he'd possibly come to love and value me one day. The way he treats me now is that of a lonely, desperate man, not a man who desires my heart and existence. If I do not benefit him in some form, my existence would be moot. I loved him either way, because my love is unconditional, but he was not reciprocal.

So here I am, with a man panicking because he could lose everything, then blaming me for his response and actions, trying to manipulate and gaslight me over awakening his soul to live in truth, honor, and love. My story is always consistent. It would be nice for it to change. I don’t know if it ever will, as I must honor my children and perhaps must one day walk away if my husband cannot find the preservation to grow from the harm he has placed into his and those around his life.

On another note, perhaps I may never live to fully experience the physical elements that true love brings. Though I am overjoyed for one change. That I finally know what love looks like, feels like, and that it exists. Who would have thought I’d ever be lucky enough to taste that powerful gift. I’m so thankful.

When they say your first love is the person you love first, I don’t actually see it that way. I think your first love is that one who truly shows, gives, and shares your reciprocation. True love is of two, and for a moment I learned what it meant to feel loved and feel whole.

Imperfectly perfect,

**Your Ink Rose** 🥀

Today, I helped a woman who seemed disoriented get to a nearby bus stop. She was asking at my restaurant, for directions to the other solids of town. No one payed attention to her, so when I came up to her to help, she only asked me for a cup of water. After giving it to her, I continued working, up until I finished my daily tasks. 
When I got off, I sat down to rest and check my messages. The woman was still there. She could barely hold herself up. She finally asked me how to get to the other side of town. She asked if I could drop her off. I told her that I walk to work. I looked up the bus route and the schedule. She inquired with much excitement about the bus. I didn’t know too much about getting from where we were to the other side of town, but I have experience taking some bus routes. I sat next to her and started to look up the information. 
We found a nearby bus stop and checked the schedule. Buses arrive every half an hour. She asked when the next one was. It would be 12:50pm. Then she asked what time it was. I checked my watch. It was 12:42pm. She got up and said “let’s go, then!” She had quite a few reusable bags full of stuff that were quite heavy. She asked if I could grab two of them. I did. We walked out of the restaurant, and I started leading her to where the map signaled a bus stop. She kept asking along the way, where it was, but it wasn’t visible from where we were. I kept reassuring her, it was down the street, in front of a local Goodwill store, but I wasn’t too sure. I explained that she would need to get a transfer ticket, so she could board the right bus at the transit station, without getting charged twice. She crossed the street in the wrong direction, so I had to redirect her back towards where I told her the right bus would pick her up. There were two bus stops across from each other, but one went to the shopping center and the other towards downtown. Judging by the direction of the traffic where the stop was placed, I told her, her best bet was the one going away from town. We were already at the edge of town, so I figured, it had to make a loop and go back to the transit station. We were literally crossing the street when the bus started showing up. I waved to the  driver. He stopped and I asked him if it was the correct bus. He affirmed and asked me to pay the fare. Luckily, I had the right amount in cash and change, because I don’t usually carry cash. I wished the woman a nice day, and let them go. 

I then worked my way back home, picking up water and a cheese pizza. I’ve been resting and healing from a sore throat I picked up somewhere along the way. I was grateful to be able to spend a beautiful Saturday with much peace.

Yesterday was wonderful. I went out and had a great breakfast, lunch, and dinner—all in one day. We even went on a long drive and got somewhat drenched in the rain, but it was so worth it. We had tea afterwards. For the first time in a long while, I felt genuinely happy. It was a perfect day.
( I even made him watch Harry Potter!!!!)

[Real] (5/24/25): Diary With Ink Rose 🥀
🥀 **V/XXIV/MMXXV**

Diary,

Within limited hours, I wonder. Where will silence today beacon me to swallow me whole?

Shall we begin this dance?

As a mother, I am strict. No, not to be cruel, but to mirror the reflection of stability. Of course, through many generations, this inheritance has been bestowed upon us as mother's below our hereditary lines. I still hold kindness, adoration, and flexibility. Though I am reserved in a manner that contradicts free spirit.

A *"Cinderella"* purged into *"Step Mother."*

A combo made within heaven and hell, defining as one...

I guess that could be the claim.

Stepping into bewilderment, where do I carry my broken feathers and sew them into unbreakable seams?

Days keep passing as if there was a race to fulfill unmet needs and chores that never departure. This, this is where anxieties build an unfortunate coming of dissary. The clothes scattered in piles, unkept dishes organized, but unmet with savor to flourish in memory. Walking simply to encourage a cleanse only it buries me once day begins to harvest a storm of wild innocence I have yet to learn to regulate.

I had belief that on a morning far ahead, the storms would quiet and growth would prevail. Perhaps there's more, more that is needed to strip back layers I have not dared touch. It carries a vunerablity I am unsure is still present to source in my grasp within my childish soul.

Will it welcome chaos, or will I finally be relieved of my duties to carry a mother who can only live in sequence of agony to prevail?

Hopeless fortune,

**Your Ink Rose** 🥀

[Real] (5/24/2025) The Thunder Cry Within Silent Sheets
🥀 **V/XXIV/MMXXV**

Diary,

To find meaning in beyond death.

This seed is planted before rose colored glasses are depleted of it's rose film. The peel is slight and warns the presence of cold nights and dreary concubines. Slow lust dragging the kill. Neglecting its sight of the dreamy moon light embraced in sparkling twilight. Is there no mercy for trembling hands and wet eyes. What cruelty must be bestowed upon to treat the blue dimming flame calling to rise.
  
Do you see me simply as a fool? Does my face inquire defenses? Why must you mock my inner child? She simply asks for her hands to be fed, for the empty to retain the void.

Your overjoy has struck the core of empty sheets and ponder yet the *'Thunder Cry Within Silent Sheets'.* Must the Ice strike your cheek to devour the cold grip you left inside me? Follow the lead of old wounds to strip your desire as you watch dry bleed. Constant it runs of deep puddles drowsing an empty. Cry of thunder, will its lead, it will not bow to you, you must bow to its greed. 

Call the *'Fallen Angel'* that grieves beneath ash preparing leave. Terrifying its existence. Shallow eyes held in resistance. Both a war cry for hollow die. One no longer heard , flame touches skin, intentional wreath for your death sheets. A silent weep of forgotten grief. Take your dance and sustain it within arse of your evil inward fleet, as the only birth of your weathered sheep must have been from decree. I no longer hold query. My end has crossed in deplete, shameless, shameful tragedy.       
  
Shroud silent leads thy *'Thunder Cry Within Sheets'.* Dearly broken unbeknownst needs, written beneath the sheen.

My heart aches a truth never imagined, never believed. 

lift thy wings...

Dearly scorned,
  
**Your Ink Rose** 🥀

[REAL] (05/25/2025) The DILF Files
Today’s flavor? Kilig. Embarrassing, girly, giggling at my phone like a 16-year-old kilig. Luisito sent me a video of himself and his son. And my God. This man. He’s not hot in that polished, GQ, Botox-at-40 kind of way. No. He’s hot in that tired, single dad, “I just picked my kid up from school and I’m wearing a soft tee that smells like coffee and safety” kind of way. Give me that kind of hot any day. That does something to me.

Look, whatever. It’s giving 80s/90s baby with an analog heart in a digital world. A little old-school connection sprinkled with modern convenience. This whole penpal, slow-burn kind of thing? I love it. I truly enjoy it. Why did I ever stop doing this? Or why didn’t I return to it sooner? I think I forgot what it felt like to make connections without all the superficial shit—no swiping, no small talk pre-screened by a face rating. Just thoughts. Just words. And damn, it’s refreshing.

Anyway, it all started as a stupid dare. I joked, “Send me a video so I know you're real.” We mostly exchange long letters, daily musings, rambling voice notes—and a few phone calls. We’ve only ever sent one or two photos to each other. But jokes are half-meant—and what do you know, he actually sent a video.

So of course, being me—the ever-pleaser—I sent one back. And now we’re texting about fairness and dimples and calling each other pleasers like we’re trying so hard to stay casual while the chemistry is doing somersaults in the background. Or maybe that’s just me. Who knows? But he is flirting back. Ugh, stop. I’m giggling like an idiot.

He said I didn’t have to send a video too, but I did. I told him he’s got cute dimples (because he does), and he complimented my curls (which I’m finally starting to love again). And now I’m sitting here, overanalyzing everything as usual, watching his video on loop like some schoolgirl who just found her new hyperfixation.

But hey—I’m grounded. For real. I'm enjoying this. I’m not spinning wild fantasies (okay, *maybe just a few*, but they’re contained, I SWEAR). I’m letting myself feel the kilig without tying it to a future that doesn’t exist—or might never. It’s just… nice. Nice to be seen. Nice to feel playful. Nice to feel light again after months of emotional hibernation. I’m grateful for the connection, whatever shape it takes.

So thank you, Universe, for this brief, bright spark. If it fizzles out? Cool. But if it burns a little longer… well, let’s just say I wouldn’t mind that either.

[Real] (5/24/25) off the deep end
You know you have a problem when....

Summer is "here"ish. My whole summer is totally jam-packed. A trip to my moms next week, a fiber festival the weekend after, father's day weekend (which I need to figure out what Im doing), a 5 day adventure to Southern Oregon.. finally I get a weekend off, then its 4th of July, my anniversary vacation, and then we finally get a few weekends of chill before we go back to back again in August, and my big 2 day adventure at the giant fiber festival in Seattle.

I might be obsessed with yarn and fiber. I had a nightmare last night I was crocheting in the car, and I dropped my favorite hook and somehow it fell out of the car entirely and got crushed by the car behind us. Only made funnier that I dropped it right as I was asking my husband if he minded if I bought more hooks. As soon as I dropped it he said "well apparently youre buying more now." Even in my dreams, he's still the most supportive husband I could ever ask for.

I've been on a spending freeze, or more accurately "only spending if it doesnt come out of my bank account" freeze so I can hoard money like a dragon and go hog wild at Flock in August. What better way to end the summer than dropping 1,000 on yarn?! Theres totally nothing unhinged about that at all. Still cheaper than crack.

With the fiber festival in two weeks though, I really want to get some projects finished so I can devote some time to spinning. I wound off the first ounce, the fiber I started spinning after I caked my first bit was so much better than my first attempt. Definitely makes me feel better about it. Spinning isnt as easy as it looks.

Im trying to categorize all the projects I have, and set goals to finish. I just need to not overdo it or I'll end up in the brace for the 3rd time this year. Moderation was never my forte. If I can get the wedding present done this weekend, I can make good headway on my daughters blanket, and my socks. Socks will probably come with me to southern Oregon, because theyre small. I really need to finish what I have before I start more, but the list of things I want to make is insanely long. And of course I have yarn for all of it.

I think we need a fiber anonymous meeting. Its a problem.

But, in true Saturday form, husband got up with princess and let me sleep in. He didnt make me coffee so that probably means we are going to Dutch. I got catch up on the YouTube videos I missed over the week and theyre watching old Disney movies.

I didn't sleep well, woke up at 1am ready to start the day. Did some thinking before I fell back asleep. I feel guilty? But not? I feel like I should be much more upset. I just ... dont? Besides being a bit confused by the toddler style temper tantrum that entered my inbox yesterday, I just ... I cant say I dont care, obviously I do. But I'm completely at peace with whatever outcome happens. Would it be sad to never have my friend back? Of course. Its not the outcome I want. But if I dont get the outcome I want, there's nothing I can do about it. Its out of my hands, the decision is not mine anymore and I'm alright with that. Hopefully he can find that same peace with his choices.

Its a really freeing feeling, actually. Even as things got heated yesterday, and things were being said with the intention to hurt and upset me, it just didn't phase me. I could see it for what it was. In or out, I offered the olive branch and that's all I can really do. Now it's time to accept the outcome and keep going. 

And maybe buy a spare crochet hook, just in case.

[real] (23/05/25) "For you, I would" means a lot
Today was... okayish. I’ve been running on very little sleep lately, but somehow, I’ve learned to navigate the "not so okay" parts of life. Things feel manageable—for now.

But I’ve been thinking about something: how the people we love often fail to see our worth until someone else comes along and treats us like we matter. They don’t realize our value until someone else starts worshiping the ground we walk on. They assume our loyalty is a result of having no other options, never realizing that it’s us—our effort, our presence—that makes them feel loved, seen, and held.

It’s not that we can’t walk away from those who don’t care enough—it’s that we choose not to. We stay so they never feel like they’re not enough. I’ve been that person for many—quietly giving, showing up, holding space. And I don’t regret it. I still don’t mind being that person going forward.

But now, I know what I deserve. I deserve someone who says, "For you, I would." and, I had that someone. Someone who showed up—not with grand gestures, but with genuine effort. Even something as simple and thoughtful as calling me at 11:50 p.m. just to be the first to wish me on my birthday at midnight. Someone who paid for me countless times, someone who hugged me throughout the night when I was running on high fever while sweating themselves, someone who got me a Harry Potter tee on my first date with them, someone who kept quiet while I had my outbursts (Yes, someone’s done that before, and it meant the world.) 

I just hope to find my person again. Even if it's for a fleeting moment, I don't mind. I miss that. Hating and loving the same person is so difficult.

[real] (05/23/2025) when people become angry
It’s good to stay calm and wait patiently for them to calm down and decide how to handle the situation. If they do come back from overreacting, then maybe you can continue moving forward with them. We can’t expect perfection, but the right intentions keep people together, longer.

[real] (22/05/2025) Breakup, Makeup, Dad’s Arrest, Flat Earth and Job Hunting. Entry 3
Hey everyone, it's me again. Monica.

So… after reading the comments from the users,  @u/mybiggestfanisme and @u/-MellonCollie- on my post yesterday ( I hope you don't mind me mentioning you guys) , I took some time to really think things through. And... I ended up getting back together with Dan. I just want to say thank you. Really. You guys helped me see things a little clearer and reminded me of the good that's still there. I had an honest conversation with him, laid everything out, and he said he’s willing to give me all the support he can. He said, “Let’s change and grow better together.” That meant a lot.

Now here comes something wild I was thinking about… what if the Earth is flat? Wait hear me out. So if we take a circle in 2D, it doesn’t feel flat, right? But when you look at it from a higher dimension like 3D, it kinda is. Same with a line in 1D — not flat until we see it from 2D. So maybe in 4D, a sphere looks flat? What if we just can’t perceive it yet? Just a random brain spiral I went on today.

But then today also hit me hard in another way. I found out something about my dad. He was actually arrested a few months back for drinking and gambling. There’s an FIR and everything. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. My dad’s name has been mixed up in a lot of things over the years… but somehow we always find a way to make things disappear. We know people — cops, politicians — who respect our family a lot. But that doesn’t stop my dad. He doesn’t earn anything, he’s drowning in debt, and he won’t even talk to us about it.

My mom is the one holding the family together financially. But she refuses to pay off the debts that came from his addictions. I’ve never once heard him appreciate her. All I’ve ever seen is fights. He blames her for ruining his life. He’s deep into everything you can imagine — alcohol, smoking, cigars, kaini, gutka, pan masala, tobacco — you name it.

He judges women based on their reels. He makes weird rules for me. Like don’t go out. Don’t talk to boys. Don’t talk to people from other castes or poor people. He can be really frustrating.

And yet… he’s my hero. That sounds strange, I know. But despite everything, he loves me so much. He’s annoying sometimes, but he's still my dad. And I love him. I’m not angry at him. Just a little sad. I wish he didn’t make these choices. But he's still my hero.

Also… on a completely different note… I’ve been thinking I need a remote job ( I'm from India). Something that gives me even the tiniest bit of independence. I’m good at math, but obviously no one wants a tutor who’s just an undergrad CS student. I’m decent at CS stuff too, but it’s super competitive to get internships these days.

I’ve been wondering if I should learn video editing or graphic design — maybe pick up a skill I can learn quickly and actually use to earn something. Marketing’s not an option for me, just putting that out there. So if you’ve got any suggestions, or if you’ve been through something similar and found something that worked, please hit me up. I’d really appreciate it.

Thanks for reading this chaotic mix of a post.

[real] (22/05/25)
Sometimes, it feels like women can be each other’s worst enemies. I’m not denying that women can also be each other’s greatest strength—but lately, I’ve encountered the kind who seem to thrive on tearing others down. They don't care if they’re falling off a cliff themselves—as long as they can make sure you don't climb either.

It’s exhausting dealing with toxic women who smile at your pain, who spread false rumors, assassinate your character, and deep inside celebrate your lowest moments just to mask their own emptiness. And the irony? These same people will turn around and perform acts of kindness just to impress someone—playing the part of a selfless, gentle soul.

Like, really? You can’t even kill a bug, but you're perfectly okay destroying someone mentally? The hypocrisy is almost comical—if it weren’t so cruel.

Grow up. 
Don't just limit your "siscode" to IG stories.

[real] (5/21/25)
What is the thing that keeps me from ever being sought after? Why does everyone notice everyone else, chase everyone else, think about them and yearn and decide in their favor? What is missing from me? Why am I always the “I could take it or leave it” option?

I sit in the background well. I do the thinking and the planning and the anticipating. I choose. I ask. And I am so fucking tired of being the one who acts, being the one whose needs go not just unmet but unconsidered. “If you’re not getting what you need, just ask for it!” Okay, but I AM asking for it, and I’m asking for it EVERY DAY and the need hasn’t changed and it would be nice if, for just one second, all these people who claim to love me and see me and care about me would not sit around and wait, would not put me in the humiliating debilitating wretched space of having to beg for consideration. 

The worst part is when people do see what I need and where my aches and gaps lie, and they promise to offer those things to me, but later. Just hang tight. Be right back, I promise, let me just take care of this thing right here and then I’ll be back to take care of you and give you the love and reassurance and closeness and care I know you need. 

Except “later” doesn’t happen. They come back and it’s like they never said the words, never made the promises, and then they’re bewildered when I wilt before their very eyes. 

I know it’s healthy to communicate. I know it’s healthy to ask. I know people can’t read minds. But I’m not asking them to read minds. I’m asking, once in a while, for people to recognize a pattern and be thoughtful. Not every day. Not every week. Once in a while. Once in a while, it would be wonderful if you could take the agonizing shameful spike of mortification out of my chest and not force me to stutter through asking you to put your arm around me. Once in a while, it would be nice to hear you say that you missed me while we were apart and that you’re happy to be home, that you know it’s been a rough day and all you want right now is to hold me tightly. Because it’s not the fucking same if I ask you if those things are true and you respond “of course.” It’s not. 

I do not want to pull the reassurances out of you anymore. I’m so fucking tired, so fucking raw and low and broken and I don’t have any more energy to reach up out of this hole in the hopes that you’ll notice I’m here. I need you to do the noticing yourself, the same way I notice you. I don’t know how much longer I can last if you don’t.

[Real] (5/21/25) what's next?
Everything seems like it's hinging on one moment. In a waiting game with no timeline.

Waiting for quotes to decide on a new roof, waiting for the weekend, waiting to hear how my moms trip to Idaho goes. Waiting for the answers at work so I can make the moves I need to keep things running. Waiting. Always waiting.

I've had a few good mornings with princess. Sometimes she's so like me it's scary. Stubborn, independent, tough. But the same girl who brings me flowers from outside, typically dandelions. The girl that loves snuggles, crafts, who's laugh is infectious and who's love knows no bounds. She's the best thing that's ever happened to me.

If i could get out of this general unease for what unknowns are in front of me, I just don't know how to shake it. Partially fear, hearing things I don't want to hear or confirming what the self critical parts of my brain tell me. Thankfully, that's mostly gone on the daily basis.

It's been a very long week. I spent all weekend a total mess, I've spend this week catching up on the sleep I missed. Not sure how much of that is thinking and how much of that is this new series I'm reading. Either way, Im tired. Maybe I can sleep off the uncertainty that seems to be following me.

[real] (05/21/2025) cheese &amp; wine
You know what my problem is? I crave attention too much. Like, whenever someone gives me the slightest bit of attention more than the average person does, I fall for them. I keep craving more of that attention. It becomes all I think about, I start envisioning my life with that person, and it genuinely feels like that's what's gonna make my life better. While in reality, pursuing those people has always led to heartbreak, one way or another.

I can't believe I fucking fell for it again. He really fucking had me. Had me believing he was a good guy. That he was different. And I know how cliché that sounds, but fuck, should I just stop believing that that's possible? Should I start believing that all men are gonna leave me feeling this hurt in the end?

Currently just filling my body with cheese and wine, trying to get over it. Crying on my balcony. I don't care, let them see it.

[REAL] (05/21/2025) Delulu but grounded (Kinda)
Once again, I’m spiraling. Well, nothing new there… I am always spiraling like my life depends on it. So here’s another grounding journal. Like damn, I’m not just doing regular journals. I’ve been doing grounding journals because I feel like my spirals are a tad bit stronger these past few days.

So… this whole thing with Luisito. Yeah. I guess if I’m being *realistic*, it helps that we’re literally oceans apart—he’s in Michigan, I’m here in the Philippines. That distance? It gives me some kind of guardrail. Keeps my brand of delulu from becoming full-blown delulu like my friend’s. At least I’m not sitting here waiting for someone who’s taken to break up just so I can swoop in. That’s not who I am. I still have lines I won’t cross, and I’m glad about that.

*(Also, my friend? A story for another time. Or maybe not. I might write about it later, tomorrow, I don’t know. Who’s to say.)*

But it doesn’t mean I’m not delulu—I am very much delulu. Hella delulu. Stupidly delulu. I probably am, just with a bit more self-control and awareness. Luisito *is* single though… with a 10-year-old son. I don’t know. I guess that adds a layer of reality that makes it feel both *possible* and *impossible* at the same time.

In this grounding journal, I was asked if I was forcing a narrative Luisito isn’t co-writing. And honestly? No. I don’t think I am. We have messages—real, warm, affectionate conversations. Receipts. Not fantasies. There’s a mutual *something* going on, even if it’s not romantic or defined. Let’s stick to platonic. We both do acknowledge that we are flirting but we both agreed that sometimes in being open, flirting happens too. It’s not like we crazily flirt, okay?

But I do want to win him over. I can admit that. It’s blurry. I like him. I’m trying not to overstep, but I can’t lie—part of me wants to be chosen. I don’t want to *chase* him or fake a persona to get him, though. I’m trying to reveal my true self. Almost recklessly. Like, “Here I am. Will you still talk to me after this?” And part of me—the scared part—is just waiting for the moment he ghosts me. There’s this voice in my head saying *“He’s gonna leave. Just you wait.”* And I almost want to prove that voice right so I can be like *“See? I knew it. Knew I wasn’t good enough.”*

But he reassured me recently. Told me we’re good. That he’s okay with me. And damn it, I felt like some clingy girlfriend reading that, when I’m just supposed to be his *friend.* Ugh.

Then there’s this other thing—in the ground exercise, I was told I don’t guilt-trip or love-bomb him. But… am I sure? I compliment him *a lot.* He even jokes about it, calls me out for spoiling him or making this abuelo smile. Is that love-bombing?

Maybe… but not intentionally. When I compliment him, I *mean it.* I’m not trying to trap him or make him feel like he owes me something. I just enjoy seeing his reaction. It makes me happy. It lights me up. And yeah, I’ll admit it gives me some kind of high. But not because I want control. It’s because it makes me feel warm and connected. There’s joy in giving, you know? And I truly enjoy making that abuelo smile.

That said… I might be *subtly* guilt-tripping when I push his compliments away. When I say, “Don’t say that,” or “You’re just being polite.” That’s probably me bracing for impact. Not wanting to let the good stuff in because I’m convinced it’s not real or that it won’t last. So I block it. And in doing so, I might be making him feel like he has to prove himself or reassure me. That’s not fair to him.

Moving forward, if he compliments me—or when we go into our compliment ping pong—I’ll just say:

**“You’re making me blush. I’m not really used to compliments, but thank you so much for your kind words. I appreciate you.”**

Short. Honest. Still vulnerable, but not self-deprecating. Not pushing love away.

I *am* trying to be more self-aware. I can name my patterns a little better now. That’s progress, right?

I’m not perfect. Sometimes I spiral. Sometimes I act like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Sometimes I think I’m showing up when I’m really just testing people to see if they’ll leave.

But I’m trying. I’m sparkling more than I’m love-bombing. I’m defending less and revealing more. And I’m learning to receive.

I’m still scared. But I’m also growing. I think I’m growing.

And I’m still suspicious and very doubtful of myself, but I think I’m quite proud of that.

[real] (05/20/2025)
I didn’t work today. I woke up and started prepping the house for cleaning. I washed blankets, cleaned the dining room table, cleaned the floors, and washed the laundry. I needed drinking water, toilet paper, and cleaning towels so I prepared to make a run around my neighborhood for these things. Once the house and clothing were tended to, it was just about the perfect time to leave the house. At 6pm, the sun is out, but not as strong. I visited the dollar tree, H2O to go, and then hurried home. Once home, there was about a half hour before my friend got off work. I decided to pass the time by working out. She arrived shortly after work. I heard her car come in the driveway and went outside to meet her. She came and gave me a hug. 

We went to the grocery store for ingredients to make tacos and fruit. Once home, I got started in cooking her meal. She helped with some things. She served herself tacos and I sat and ate chips with her. She stayed on her phone and rested while I continued to workout in the living room. I then came to join her during my break. We stayed on the phone for a little while. She then had to go home, so I walked with her on the way out. After she arrived home, she called me. We spoke for a little while, then got ready for bed. We wished each other a goodnight and gave thanks. I do feel like sleeping. 
Good night.
